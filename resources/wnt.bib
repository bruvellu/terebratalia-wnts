  note = {I soon found that it would be impossible to work out the cell lineage,
  not only because of a lack of sufficient number of cleavage stages, but also
  and chiefly because of the great difficulties which the material itself
  offered; the eggs were quite opaque and, except in a few cases, it was
  impossible to render nuclei visible in preparations of the entire egg; the
  cleavage was almost entirely equal and I was unable to find any constant
  landmarks which might be used in orientation, and finally the cleavage was
  found to be more or less irregular and inconstant.<div><br></div><div>Eggs not
  kidney-shape but elliptical. Ovishell until 20 cell
  stage.</div><div><br></div><div>Pg 53: Description of the mantle furrows.
  </div><div><br></div><div>These constrictions, which I have called the
  anterior and posterior mantle furrows, continue to grow deeper but at no time
  do they form true septa which divide the coelom. The regions which they
  separate are not, therefore, segments, as Kowalevsky supposed. The larva is at
  this, and all other stages which I have sutied, unsegmentd, and the appearance
  of segmentation is due merely to the formation of the mantle from the middle
  region of the body.</div><div><br></div><div>My observation as to the location
  of the stomodael invagination thus confirms Heider's theoretical suggestion
  and brings the brachiopod larva into close relationship with the
  trochophore.</div><div><br></div><div>The coelom however is never segmented
  though it may be constricted in certain
  places.</div><div><br></div><div>Constrictions are connected with the
  extension of the coelom into the mantle lobes, but they never coincide in
  position with the superficial constrictions of the body (mantle
  furrows).</div><div><br></div><div>Although, I am not one of those who expect
  to find phylogeny "writ large" in ontogeny, yet it may be worth while to point
  out the bearings of the development of Terebratulina on the supposed
  relationships of brachiopods.</div><div><br></div><div>Cleavage: impossible at
  present either to affirm or deny their presence in Terebratulina. certain that
  mesoderm is not formed by teloblastic growth from a single cell and that the
  embryo does not grow in length by teleoblastic cleavage of two
  somatoblasts.</div><div><br></div><div>Mesoderm: typical invagination, no
  phylogenetic significance can be attributed to it. Unlike annelids, mollusks,
  platyhelminths, nematodes, arthropods. Resemblances, but not very close with
  chaetognaths and echinoderms.</div><div><br></div><div>I cannot regard the
  coelom formation in chaetognaths and brachiopods as being more than analogous
  processes, and as such devoid of phylogenetic
  significance.</div><div><br></div><div>Orientation of embryo and larva: egg
  animal pole and gastrula apical pole become cephalic lobe. Blastopore narrows
  and closes from behind; stomodaeum forms where blastopore
  closed.</div><div><br></div><div>Characters are too general and have little
  value to trace the affinities of the
  brachiopods.</div><div><br></div><div>General morphology of larva: Trochophore
  like characteristics are (5) apical tuft of cilia, (6) preoral ciliated band,
  (7) postoral ciliated band, (8) adoral ciliated zone, (11) epithelial nervous
  system, (12) apical plate, ganglion and sense organs, (13) oeshophageal nerves
  and buccal (ventral) ganglion, (15) alimentary canal horseshoe-shaped and
  ciliated, (16) stomach retort-shaped, (17) intestine reaches to posterior end
  of the body, (23) mesothelium gives rise to the paired protonephridium, which
  is a longitudinal ciliated tube closed at the anterior end by terminal cells,
  and opening posteriorly on the ventral side in from of the anus. In addition,
  bilateral symmetry, blastopore ventral, ciliation, mesoderm
  mesenchy/epithelial, ventral/dorsal longitudinal muscles. Ectodermal seta sacs
