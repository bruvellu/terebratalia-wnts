# Abstract

Wnt signaling is crucial for embryonic development in multiple ways. One major
role is anteroposterior patterning and establishment of developmental
boundaries. Receptor-context has been shown to be important for the signaling
outcome. However, a combined analysis of Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors is
often lacking. Here, we analyze the developmental expression of Wnt signaling
components in the brachiopod *Terebratalia transversa*, a spiralian whose
larval body is subdivided into distinct regions. We find that Frizzled
receptors are expressed in broad axial domains while Wnt ligands are expressed
in localized, partially overlapping territories distributed along the
anteroposterior axis. The combinatorial expression reveals that during axial
elongation *T. transversa* body is subdivided into a series of domains series
with unique transcriptional fingerprint, each containing a different
combination of ligands, receptors and antagonists of the Wnt pathway. These
domains coincide with the morphological boundaries of the developing larval
body regions suggesting that the ligand-receptor context might play a role in
the specification and morphogenesis of the brachiopod larval body regions.
While the expression of specific Wnt ligands is clearly labile between
bilaterian clades, some ligand-receptor contexts might be evolutionary
conserved. This work suggests that is crucial to consider the unique
combination of ligand-receptor frizzled and other receptors in future
comparative studies to better understand the evolution of bilaterian
anteroposterior patterning.

<!--TODO: The paragraphs below are more for the introduction.-->

<!--The discovery of multiple wnt genes, their crucial developmental roles and their complex expression domains has raised ideas about a wnt code [@Guder2006-fu]. An idea that different wnts can pattern and specify different body regions according to their combinatorial territories. Much in parallel with the discovery of the Hox system. However, accumulated evidence reveals that the Wnt system is much more imbricated modular and multifunctional than the Hox patterning.-->

<!--First is the finding that wnt ligands are not long- but short-ranged signaling activity [@Loh2016-pz]. The consequence is that wnt function is more local and allow for more complex patterning outcomes.-->

<!--Second, the idea that is not a specific wnt ligand that mediate specific signaling, but that the receptor context dictates the Wnt signaling outcome [@Loh2016-pz]. This implies that the same ligand can trigger different outcomes based on the receptor it binds to. This put a greater importance when studying wnt signaling on analyzing the receptor context in conjunction to ligands.-->

# Results

## Wnt ligands

To characterize the dynamics of gene expression during embryonic development,
we analyzed the temporal profile of Wnt signaling components using RNA-seq data
generated from developmental stages of *T. transversa* (ACCESSION). We detect
high levels of *wnt4* and *wntA* transcripts maternally loaded in the
unfertilized oocyte (@fig:profiling). Other Wnt genes, such as *wnt5*, *wnt6*,
and *wnt16*, are also expressed in the oocytes, but at lower levels. The
remaining Wnt ligands are barely detected at this stage.

The Wnt landscape changes at the late blastula stage (19h) when there is a
concerted upregulation of *wnt1*, *wnt8*, *wnt10* and *wnt16* in the embryo
(@fig:profiling). *wnt8* and *wnt6* are the genes that undergo the greatest
shift in expression levels. There is a second wave of activation at the onset
of gastrulation with the increase of *wnt1*, *wnt5* and *wnt6* at the early
gastrula. These transcriptional changes are followed by the upregulation of
*wnt7* and *wnt11* at the mid gastrula, and finally, by the activation of
*wnt2*, *wnt9* and *wnt10* at the late gastrula. Thus, different Wnt ligands
are upregulated at different moments during embryogenesis, but between the late
gastrula and early larva stages, all Wnts are expressed in the tissues of the
developing *T. transversa* embryo.

While the expression of *wnt1*, *wnt4*, *wnt5*, *wnt8*, *wnt9*, *wntA* remains
high until the juvenile stages, the expression levels of *wnt6* and *wnt10*
begin to decay after gastrulation. After metamorphosis, we detect a notable
downregulation of *wnt7* and *wnt16* in the juvenile individuals
(@fig:profiling).

![Expression of Wnt ligands, Frizzled receptors
and Wnt antagonists throughout *Terebratalia transversa* developmental
stages.](figures/profiling.png){#fig:profiling width=100%}

To identify the spatial localization of Wnt genes in developing embryos of *T.
transversa*, we analyzed the expression of the thirteen ligands from the early
gastrula until the late larva stage by in situ hybridization (@fig:ligands1 and
!@fig:ligands2).

*T. transversa* Wnt ligands are expressed in diverse ectodermal domains in all
body regions except the apical portion of the apical lobe. The anteriormost Wnt
transcripts are bilateral anterior territories of *wnt5* and *wnt8* that we
detect in the early and mid gastrula stages. At the same stage we also observe
lateral patches of *wnt16* next to the blastopore. Many Wnt genes are expressed
at the posterior portion of the blastoporal lip, such as *wnt1*, *wnt6* and
*wnt11*, but Wnt ligands are notably absent from the anterior portion of the
blastoporal lip. In addition, Wnt ligands are also expressed in the mantle lobe
(e.g., *wnt5*), the middle section of the larval body, and in more localized
endodermal and mesodermal tissues (e.g. *wnt6* and *wnt9*).

<!--TODO: Include short sentence about profiling for each gene?-->

<!--TODO: Include the expression of wnt1b, if available.-->

*wnt1* expression has been previously described in *T. transversa*
[@Vellutini2016-lq]. The transcripts are detected in three distinct
territories. A domain at the posterior end of the blastopore lip which expands
laterally, acquires a subterminal position during gastrulation, and finally
forms a ring of *wnt1* expression that subdivides the pedicle lobe in the late
larva (@fig:ligands1 and @Vellutini2016-lq). At the late gastrula stage apical
lobe cells bordering the mantle lobe begin to express *wnt1* forming a
transversal stripe (@fig:ligands1 and @Vellutini2016-lq). Additionally, *wnt1*
is expressed in a central mid body patch in the dorsal region
[@Vellutini2016-lq].

*wnt2* transcripts are not detected by in situ hybridization in the early and
mid gastrula stages. At the late gastrula, broad bilateral bands of
*wnt2*-expressing cells encircle the posterior portion of the apical lobe but
without reaching the ventral or dorsal midline (@fig:ligands1). The pattern
persists at the early larva, but is cleared in the late larval stages
(@fig:ligands1).

*wnt4* is expressed at the posterior end in the early and mid gastrula stages
(@fig:ligands1) but the transcripts are localized more dorsally than *wnt1*
({@fig:doubles}A). In the early larva the domain shifts to a subterminal
position at the pedicle lobe that partially overlaps with the posterior
territory of *wnt1* ({@fig:doubles}B). In the late larva, *wnt4* is expressed
in a ring at the anteriormost portion of the pedicle
lobe (@fig:ligands1).

![Whole-mount colorimetric in situ hybridization of Wnt ligands in
*Terebratalia transversa* (*wnt8*, *wnt9*, *wnt10*, *wnt11*, *wnt16* and
*wntA*).](figures/ligands2.png){#fig:ligands2 width=100%}

*wnt5* exhibits three distinct ectodermal domains of expression in *T.
transversa*. They localize to the apical, mantle and pedicle lobe of the larva
(@fig:ligands1). In the early gastrula we detect *wnt5* transcripts at the
posterior end of the blastopore lip (@fig:ligands1). During gastrulation this
domain becomes narrower than the overlapping posterior domain of *wnt1*
({@fig:doubles}C) acquires a terminal position in the developing pedicle lobe
(@fig:ligands1 and {@fig:doubles}D,E). In the late larva stage, with the
subdivision of the pedicle lobe, *wnt5* is cleared from its terminal portion
but remains strongly expressed in a subterminal region of the pedicle lobe
(@fig:ligands1). The other two domains of *wnt5* are also detected early during
gastrulation and form broad bilateral territories that correspond to the middle
region of the apical and mantle lobes (@fig:ligands1). Except for a narrow row
of cells at the apical lobe, and at the posterior blastopore lip, the
expression domains of *wnt5* and *wnt1* do not coincide ({@fig:doubles}D,E). In
the early and late larva stages the apical domain of *wnt5* becomes weaker,
while the mantle lobe territory becomes restricted to the growing edge of the
mantle lobe (@fig:ligands1).

*wnt6* is expressed at the posterior blastopore lip in the early and mid
gastrula stages. At the end of gastrulation *wnt6* is also expressed at the
middle portion of the closing blastopore lip in a domain that localizes to
endodermal tissues (@fig:ligands1). At the late larva *wnt6* is faintly
expressed in the apical, mid gut and pedicle lobe.

*wnt7* transcripts are detected early during gastrulation in a bilateral pair
of laterodorsal patches (@fig:ligands1). These patches develop into a thin
stripe of expression localizing precisely to the boundary between the apical
and mantle lobes (@fig:ligands1). The expression partially overlaps with the
*engrailed*-positive stripe of cells at the anteriormost region of the mantle
lobe ({@fig:doubles}F; see also [@Vellutini2016-lq]). One additional striped
domain of *wnt7* appears in the pedicle lobe of the early larva at the
interface between the *wnt1* and *wnt5* posterior territories
({@fig:doubles}F).

![Whole-mount double-fluorescent in situ hybridization of Wnt ligands in
*Terebratalia transversa*.](figures/doubles.png){#fig:doubles width=100%}

*wnt8* is highly expressed in the early gastrula stage in a posterodorsal
domain and in a pair of anterolateral territories (@fig:ligands2). While the
posterior domain fades during gastrulation, the anterior transcripts expand
ventrally and dorsally forming broad bilateral bands of *wnt8* expression in
the apical lobe. This domain partially overlaps with the anterior *wnt1*
transcripts ({@fig:doubles}G).

*wnt9* transcripts are detected in the late gastrula stage on the middle
portion of the blastopore lip. These cells are internalized and, in the late
larva stage, *wnt9* is expressed in a pair of anterior bilateral mesodermal
domains and in the endoderm (@fig:ligands2).

*wnt10* expression begins in the posterior end at the mid gastrula stage in a
domain that localizes to the pedicle lobe in the larva (@fig:ligands2).

*wnt11* is strongly expressed in a posterodorsal domain during gastrulation. At
the early and late larva stages *wnt11* expressing cells encircle a subregion of
the pedicle lobe (@fig:ligands2). In addition, we detect *wnt11* transcripts
in more anterior patches in the pedicle lobe during gastrulation and in the mid
and posterior gut in the early larva stage.

*wnt16* transcripts are detected in broad bilateral domains around the
blastopore opening in the early gastrula (@fig:ligands2). The domains localize
to the mantle lobe, are internalized during gastrulation and in later stages
*wnt16* expression is present in an anterior mesodermal domain.

*wntA* is not expressed during early stages of gastrulation but in a pair of
broad ventral patches bordering the blastopore in the apical lobe in late
gastrula and early larva stages (@fig:ligands2). At the late larva *wntA* is
expressed in a pair of mesodermal bands that extend adjacent to the mouth
opening lining the anterior and mid endoderm.

In summary, the expression territories of Wnt ligands in *T. transversa*
partially overlap and can be divided into four groups of genes. Anterior
domains in the apical lobe (*wnt2*, *wnt8*, *wnt5*, *wntA*), mid body domains
in the mantle lobe (mainly *wnt5* and *wnt16*), subterminal domains in the
pedicle lobe (*wnt1*, *wnt4*, *wnt9* and *wnt10*), and terminal domains in the
pedicle lobe (*wnt5*, *wnt6*, *wnt11*).

The early expression domains at the anterior and posterior regions initially
overlap. However, as embryonic development progresses, these territories
differentiate into distinct subregions of the larval body. For instance, the
overlapping domains at the posterior portion of the blastopore will segregate
and occupy different subregions of the pedicle lobe in the late larva stage. 

In addition, *wnt1* and *wnt7* have domains of expression at the boundaries
between the apical and mantle lobes, and between the subterminal and terminal
portions of the pedicle lobe. These Wnt domains differentially overlap with the
receptor territories forming a complex landscape of ligand-receptor
combinations.

## Frizzled receptors

<!--TODO: Check for other Fz orthologs?-->

We identify four orthologs of Frizzled receptors in *T. transversa* referred
here as *fz1/2/7*, *fz4*, *fz5/8* and *fz9/10* (@fig:supplementary).
Transcripts of *fz1/2/7* and *fz5/8* are maternally deposited and highly
expressed until the late blastula stage while *fz4* and *fz9/10* expression
increases at the onset of gastrulation (@fig:profiling). The levels of
*fz1/2/7* and *fz4* remain high while *fz9/10* and *fz5/8*
expression decrease in the juvenile stages (@fig:profiling).

Frizzled receptors are expressed in complex spatial patterns that include broad
non-overlapping ectodermal domains. However, they are also detected in specific
mesodermal and endodermal tissues in the developing *T. transversa* embryos.
Except for *fz1/2/7*, which is expressed almost ubiquitously, *fz4* and *fz5/8*
are expressed in anterior subregions of the apical lobe and *fz9/10* is
predominantly more posterior in the mantle and pedicle lobes (@fig:receptors).

![Whole-mount colorimetric in situ hybridization of Frizzled receptors in
*Terebratalia transversa*.](figures/frizzled.png){#fig:receptors width=100%}

<!--TODO: Include short sentence about profiling for each gene?-->

*fz1/2/7* is expressed in the ectoderm and mesoderm in the early gastrula
(@fig:receptors). During gastrulation the transcripts are slightly cleared from
the pedicle lobe and *fz1/2/7* remains expressed in anterior ecto and
mesodermal tissues. In the late larva stage, we also detect transcripts at the
terminal portion of the pedicle lobe (@fig:receptors).

*fz4* is expressed in a subapical ectodermal ring encircling the animal pole in
the early gastrula stage and in the anterior portion of the mesoderm
(@fig:receptors and @fig:supplementary). The *fz4* ring demarcates the base of
the apical lobe and, together with the anterior mesoderm domain, is expressed
throughout development. In the larval stages we detect novel ectodermal domains
of *fz4* at the boundary between the mantle and pedicle lobe and at the
posterior tip of the pedicle lobe (@fig:receptors).

*fz5/8* transcripts form an ectodermal apical domain in the early gastrula
stage (@fig:receptors and @fig:supplementary). This domain is complementary to
the *fz4* domain in the apical lobe. During gastrulation *fz5/8* begins to be
expressed in the anterior portion of the mesoderm in a domain narrower than the
*fz4* territory (@fig:receptors). In the late larva stage both anterior ecto
and mesodermal domains continue to be expressed, and *fz5/8* transcripts are
also detected in the mesoderm of chaetae sacs (@fig:receptors).

*fz9/10* is expressed in a broad ectodermal territory around the blastopore lip
in the early gastrula stage (@fig:receptors). Transcripts are progressively
cleared first from the apical domain, then from the posterior portion of the
embryo and *fz9/10* expression remains mostly in the middle portion of the body,
which extend from the posterior portion of the apical lobe to the anterior
portion of the pedicle lobe (@fig:receptors). *fz9/10* is broadly expressed in
the mesoderm throughout development and is also detected in the endoderm of the
early larva stage (@fig:receptors).

In summary, Frizzled receptors are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of
the gastrulating embryo except for the posterior terminal portion of the
pedicle lobe. These domains can be divided into five unique territories formed
by a distinct combination of each receptor. At the anterior most portion of the
apical lobe (*fz1/2/7* and *fz5/8*), at the medial portion of the apical lobe
(*fz1/2/7* and *fz4*), at the posteriormost portion of the apical lobe and
anterior most portion of the mantle lobe (*fz1/2/7* and *fz9/10*), the middle
and posterior portion of the mantle lobe (*fz1/2/7*), and at the anterior
portion of the pedicle lobe (*fz9/10*). The terminal region is free of Frizzled
expression during gastrulation and only *fz4* and *fz1/2/7* are upregulated in
the late larva stage.

<!--TODO: Mention here ligand-receptor context?-->

## Wnt antagonists

<!--TODO: No match for sfrp3/4, really?-->

We identified orthologs for three Wnt antagonist genes in *T. transversa*
(@fig:supplementary). One secreted frizzled-related protein (*sfrp*), dickkopf
(*dkk*) and Wnt inhibitory factor (*wif*). The *sfrp* protein is an ortholog of
*sfrp1/2/5*. We found no matches for *sfrp3/4* in our transcriptomic data.
While *sfrp1/2/5* is highly expressed throughout development, *dkk* is
upregulated at the late blastula stage and downregulated in the juvenile stages
(@fig:profiling). *wif* expression is relatively constant along the
developmental stages with a peak at the late gastrula stage (@fig:profiling).

*sfrp* is expressed in an apical ectodermal domain and in a narrow anterior
mesoderm patch in a pattern that closely recapitulates the expression of
*fz5/8* (@fig:inhibitors). In the early larva we detect an additional bilateral
domain of *sfrp* expression in the mesoderm of the mantle lobe
(@fig:inhibitors). *dkk* expression is similar to *sfrp* except that it is
restricted to the apical ectodermal domains without any mesodermal transcripts
(@fig:inhibitors). *wif* follows a different pattern and is mainly expressed in
the mesoderm throughout all developmental stages (@fig:inhibitors).

![Whole-mount colorimetric in situ hybridization of Wnt inhibitors in
*Terebratalia transversa*.](figures/antagonists.png){#fig:inhibitors
width=100%}

## Intracellular components

We identified the *T. transversa* orthologs for the intracellular components of
the Wnt pathway for dishevelled (*dvl*), *axin* and *beta-catenin*
(@fig:supplementary). The three genes are highly expressed in every
developmental stage and, while *dvl* and *axin* maternal levels decrease after
the mid blastula stage, the amount of *beta-catenin* transcripts remains
constant throughout throughout development (@fig:supplementary).

*dvl* transcripts localize to a narrow ectodermal apical domain and the
adjacent territory in the anterior mesoderm throughout development
(@fig:intracellular). This apical domains are cleared in the late larva and
*dvl* is upregulated in the mesoderm in the dorsal portion of the mantle lobe.

*axin* is broadly expressed in the early gastrula with higher expression at the
posterior end (@fig:intracellular). At the late gastrula and early larva it is
mostly expressed in a pair of bilateral bands at the anterior portion of the
pedicle lobe which correspond to the wnt1 domain, as well as in the mantle lobe
mesoderm adjacent to the endoderm (@fig:intracellular).

*beta-catenin* is ubiquitously expressed in the ecto and mesoderm until the
late gastrula when the ectodermal transcripts are downregulated
(@fig:intracellular). During larval development mesoderm expression is also
downregulated and in the late larva stage *beta-catenin* transcripts are
restricted to the anterior mesoderm and to the mesoderm associated with the
chaetae sacs in the mantle lobe (@fig:intracellular).

the Wnt signaling pathway in *Terebratalia

## Cell-polarity pathway

<!--TODO: Integrate the pcp pathway into the manuscript.-->

We identified *T. transversa* orthologs for the components of the cell polarity
pathway (PCP Pathway, non-canonical Wnt Pathway) and analyzed their expression
during the period of axial elongation (early to late gastrula).

<!--Unique ligand-receptor contexts coincide brachiopod body regions-->

<!--TODO: Transform the ligand-receptor into results.-->

<!--TODO: Transport discussion topics to the discussion.-->

During *T. transversa* embryonic development, Wnt ligands and Frizzled
receptors are expressed in a complex landscape of domains along the
anteroposterior axis (@fig:summary). By analyzing the combinatorial expression
of Wnt ligands, receptors and antagonists, we can identify seven broad
ectodermal territories, each with a unique transcriptional profile (Table 2).
Frizzled receptors are expressed in broad domains while Wnt ligands are
expressed in partially overlapping domains with differing anteroposterior or
dorsoventral limits. Interestingly, these domains correspond to morphological
landmarks along *T. transversa* larval body.

![Summary of Wnt signaling gene expression territories in the ectoderm of the
brachiopod *Terebratalia transversa* during
gastrulation.](figures/summary.png){#fig:summary width=100%}

At the anteriormost tip, we observe a ligand-free zone where antagonists are
expressed. At the posteriormost tip we find a receptor-free zone where only
some ligands are expressed. The extent of the molecular territories in between
correlate with the body regions of the brachiopod larva, the apical, mantle and
pedicle lobes, and the morphological boundaries that separate them.

<!--TODO: Check role of sfrp and dkk in setting up neural fates.-->

The anterior tip expresses *fz1/2/7* and *fz5/8*. There are no Wnt ligands
expressed near the anterior tip, and given that Wnt ligands likely have a
limited diffusion [@refs], it is unlikely that the Frizzled receptors at the
anterior most tip interact with any Wnt ligand during the embryonic development
of *T. transversa*. In this region, however, both *sfrp* and *dkk* are
expressed at the tip of the apical lobe. This inhibitors have been implicated
in determining neural fates [@refs] and are likely involved in the patterning
and formation of the neuropile and apical organ which develop in the region
[@refs]. 

<!--TODO: Do Frizzled receptors interact with something else?-->

<!--TODO: Read about interactions of these genes with fz1/2/7 and fz4.-->

Another transcriptional subregion is an anterior group with *wntA*, *wnt8*,
*wnt2* and *wnt5* that are expressed in the apical lobe with partially
overlapping domains. For instance, *wntA* is located only ventrally near the
mouth while *wnt8* is expressed laterally and *wnt2* more dorsally. While
*wnt5* encircles the whole circumference of the apical lobe. These genes are
often associated with head development [@refs]. In *T. transversa*, they are
likely involved in the subdivision of the apical lobe into a posterior enlarged
region and a more narrow anterior part [@refs].

<!--TODO: Check roles of the above wnts related to head development.-->

<!--TODO: Check morphological description of the apical lobe morphology.-->

<!--TODO: Anything known about the interactions of wnt1 with these fzs?-->

At the interface of the apical-mantle boundary there is another transcriptional
subregion which expresses a narrow ring of *wnt7*-positive cells. wnt7 has been
described to be involved in [@refs]. In addition, the apical-mantle boundary is
abutted by *wnt1* (anterior) and *engrailed* (posterior) stripes
[@Vellutini2016-lq]. This arrangement is highly conserved in arthropod trunk
segmentation and has a role in setting up segment polarity [@refs]. In
Drosophila and others, it is known or suggested that the receptor mediating
wnt1 signaling is fzX [@refs]. In *T. transversa* this seems to be the same or
different because the Frizzled receptors expressed in the apical-mantle
boundary are fz1/2/7 and fz9/10.

<!--TODO: Fetch references to support the above paragraph.-->

<!--TODO: Elaborate the wnt5 discussion, it’s interesting.-->

The mantle lobe is the region that undergoes dramatic morphogenetic changes
during development, where the tissues grow and elongate forming the mantle.
Here we identified another ligand-receptor combination. The region is covered
by *fz1/2/7* and the main ligand is *wnt5*. *wnt16* is also expressed but
restricted to the ventral portion bordering the blastopore. Interestingly,
*wnt5* regulates tissue elongation by controlling convergent extension in other
animals [see refs in @Loh2016]. These morphogenetic changes might depend upon
the activation of the cell polarity cascade (noncanonical Wnt pathway). Because
the presence of *fz4* causes the activation of the *beta-catenin* cascade
(canonical Wnt pathway) [@refs], the cascade signaling in the mantle lobe of
*T. transversa* might be mediated by *fz1/2/7*. Therefore, the fact that *wnt5*
expression correlates with the growing/elongating mantle lobe, and is expressed
at the growing tips, suggests that convergent extension might be the
developmental mechanism involved and the basis on how the mantle is formed.

<!--TODO: Maybe check the wnt1 receptor and refer to the apical-mantle above.-->

The posteriormost Frizzled-expressing territory in *T. transversa* is a
distinct band of *fz9/10* immediately posterior to the mantle lobe. Wnt ligands
here are expressed in partially overlapping domains, but covering subregions.
*wnt1* for instance occupies the ventral and lateral portion, while *wnt6* is
on the dorsal side. Here again we observe the same arrangement of *wnt1* and
*wnt7* as present in the apical-mantle lobe boundary. We observe a similar or
different arrangement in other animals [@refs]. The fact that seem to coincide
with the *fz9/10* territories during *T. transversa* gastrulation is rather
interesting and suggest they could be interacting with this particular
receptor.

<!--TODO: Check interaction between wnt1 and wnt7 and fz9/10.-->

<!--TODO: Find out if any of these posterior genes have any role elsewhere.-->

Finally, at the posterior tip of the T. transversa embryo there is a
Frizzled-free zone where the ligands *wnt5*, *wnt6* and *wnt11* are expressed.
One possibility is that these genes are interacting with other co-receptors
[@refs]. It seems likely they are not signaling via the cell fate pathway
mediated by beta-catenin (canonical). Such region might not respond to the
overactivation of the Wnt pathway, and retain the terminal identity, as in the
wnt-independent posterior tip region described in @Darras. 

<!--TODO: Look into wnt5, wnt6, and wnt11 posterior terminal expression.-->

Overall, the specific ligand-receptor combinations expressed along the
anteroposterior axis of *T. transversa* coincides with the major body regions
and their subregions. This suggests that the different ligand-receptor context
can be involved in setting up the identities or differentially patterning the
tissue fates of the different body regions of the brachiopod *T. transversa*.

# Discussion

## The Wnt complement of *T. transversa* is mostly complete 

<!--TODO: Elaborate on Wnt complement discussion.-->

<!--TODO: Remove genome synteny discussion.-->

<!--Despite the frequent loss of individual Wnts in specific animal lineages [@Cho2010-eb; @Janssen2010-dc], genomic data revealed that some Wnts are contiguous in the genome of several animal lineages, indicating the existence of two ancestral gene clusters, *(wnt9)-wnt1-wnt6-wnt10* and *wnt5-wnt7* [@Nusse2001-rq; @Sullivan2007-xk; @Bolognesi2008-wm; @Cho2010-eb; @Janssen2010-dc].-->

<!--We found two clusters with syntenic loci for *wnt1-wnt6-wnt10* and *wnt5-wnt7* that correspond to the putative ancestral Wnt clusters. Wnt synteny in *T. transversa* is similar to the arrangement of Wnt genes in the genome of the brachiopod *Lingula anatina* [@Luo2015-lm; @Luo2018-lj]. In *L. anatina*, however, *wnt9* is adjacent to *wnt1* and *wnt16* is located in the 5’ end of the *wnt5-wnt7* cluster scaffold [@Luo2015-lm; @Luo2018-lj].-->

<!--Although we find no paralog duplications in the transcriptome of *T. transversa*, we found a remnant fragment of a Wnt gene adjacent to *wnt10* in the genome. The sequence orthology closely matches *wnt10* and the fragment is located at the 3’ of *wnt10*, where the duplicated copy of *L. anatina* is located. This suggests that *wnt10* duplication probably occurred early on the brachiopod lineage and was secondarily lost in the *T. transversa*.-->

<!--Due to the preliminary nature of our genomic data, these observations still need to be corroborated by more contiguous assembly and data from additional brachiopod species.-->

Metazoans have a diverse repertoire of Wnt genes with 13 subfamilies which
evolved by ancient gene duplications [@Kusserow2005-xd; @Croce2009-vv;
@Cho2010-eb]. Our data suggests the brachiopod *T. transversa* has an almost
complete set of Wnt genes, with the exception of *wnt3*, which is known to have
been lost at the base of the protostome lineage [@Cho2010-eb; @Janssen2010-dc].

<!--TODO: Incorporate discussion about duplications in brachiopoda and spiralia.-->

<!--Based on the available transcriptome, we found two copies of *wnt1* in *T. transversa*. While the lingulid brachiopod *Lingula anatina* also has lineage-specific duplications of *wnt1* and *wnt10* [@Luo2015-lm], our phylogenetic analysis suggests that *L. anatina* has a more recent lineage-specific duplication of *wnt1a*. The genes wnt1a and wnt1b seem to be an older duplication in spiralians.-->

<!--TODO: Run a tree specific for wnt1 to solve this.-->

## The maternal load of Wnt ligands is evolutionary labile, but *fz1/2/7* is commonly deposited in metazoan eggs

The early developmental role of Wnt signaling in specifying the embryonic
primary axis has been shown to occur in different bilaterian lineages [@refs].
However, in most cases, the identity of the ligand/receptor has not been
demonstrated [@refs]. Nevertheless, Wnt signaling activity in early development
depends upon the maternal load of pathway components deposited in the egg.

We found that in the oocytes of *T. transversa*, *wnt4* and *wntA* mRNAs are
the highest expressed Wnt ligands maternally loaded, suggesting they might be
involved in the early signaling events that pattern the animal-vegetal axis.
However, these specific ligands are not always deposited maternally in other
bilaterians. While most animal lineages exhibit a maternal load of Wnt ligands
(Table 1), there is considerable variability in which ligands are deposited in
the eggs. Even within brachiopods there are significant differences in the
maternal load of Wnt ligands (@fig:supplementary).

This suggests that the identity of Wnt ligands deposited in the eggs of
different bilaterians is highly labile and even vary among closely related
groups with similar developmental modes.

In contrast, most species investigated so far load in their eggs the Frizzled
receptor *fz1/2/7* (Table 1). This pattern is highly conserved among metazoans
[@Bastin2015-oz]. The contrasting variability in the ligand identity and
conservation of receptor identity suggests that the early role is deployed
regardless of the specific ligand deposited in the egg. Supports the idea that
the receptor context rather than a specific wnt ligand might crucial for the
signaling output [@Loh2016-pz].

<!--TODO: Examples of AV roles and ligand-receptor identity revealed.-->

## Receptor context might play a role in the specification of different brachiopod body regions

<!--TODO: How does Wnt signaling intersects with Hox expression?-->

Our gene expression data reveals a complex landscape of Wnt signaling
components along the anteroposterior axis of the brachiopod *T. transversa*
(@fig:summary). These include seven broad ectodermal territories with unique
combinations of Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors. While the domains of
expression of most Wnt ligands are restricted to a single body region, *wnt1*,
*wnt5* and *wnt7* are expressed in multiple body regions, and different
receptor contexts.

*wnt5* is expressed in the apical lobe, in the mantle lobe and in the terminal
portion of the pedicle lobe. Therefore, the expression of the ligand overlaps
with the expression of the receptors *fz1/2/7* and *fz4* in the apical lobe,
*fz1/2/7* in the mantle lobe and no Frizzled in the pedicle lobe. These
different receptor contexts coincide with different morphological outcomes of
these body regions.

The posterior region of the apical lobe where *wnt5* and other Wnts are
expressed, corresponds to a region that undergoes intense cell proliferation
forming an enlarged appearance in the late larva. The region expresses *fz4*
which is associated with the activation of the *beta-catenin* cascade
(canonical Wnt pathway) [@refs], and therefore could be mediating the cell
proliferation in the apical lobe.

<!--TODO: Check morphological description of the apical lobe morphology.-->

The mantle lobe, in contrast, *wnt5* only overlaps by *fz1/2/7*. The region
undergoes dramatic morphogenetic changes during development, where the tissues
grow and elongate forming an extended mantle in the late larva. Interestingly,
*wnt5* regulates tissue elongation by controlling convergent extension in other
animals [see refs in @Loh2016]. These morphogenetic changes might depend upon
the activation of the cell polarity cascade (noncanonical Wnt pathway) and the
signaling cascade in the mantle lobe of *T. transversa* might be mediated by
*fz1/2/7*. We thus speculate that the developmental mechanism involved in the
elongation of the mantle lobe is convergent extension.

The activity of Wnt ligands without Frizzled receptors has been described in
[@refs]. That might be the case for the terminal wnt5 domain in the pedicle
lobe.

These observations suggest that in the case of *wnt5* the receptor context, and
possibly the presence of other ligands, might play a role in determining the
signaling being activated. And therefore, be important for the differentiation
of brachiopod larval body regions.

<!--TODO: Continue from here.-->

Another example is *wnt1* and *wnt7* where in the region containing *fz1/2/7*
and *fz9/10* the stripes coincide with the deep epithelial invagination of the
apical-mantle boundary, while in the region containing only *fz9/10* the
morphological features are different. wnt7 has been described to be involved in
[@refs]. In addition, the apical-mantle boundary is abutted by *wnt1*
(anterior) and *engrailed* (posterior) stripes [@Vellutini2016-lq]. This
arrangement is highly conserved in arthropod trunk segmentation and has a role
in setting up segment polarity [@refs]. In Drosophila and others, it is known
or suggested that the receptor mediating wnt1 signaling is fzX [@refs]. In *T.
transversa* this seems to be the same or different because the Frizzled
receptors expressed in the apical-mantle boundary are fz1/2/7 and fz9/10.

<!--TODO: Get examples of Wnt activity without Frizzled receptors.-->

<!--TODO: Anything known about the interactions of wnt1 with these fzs?-->

<!--TODO: Fetch references to support the above paragraph.-->

<!--TODO: Elaborate the wnt5 discussion, it’s interesting.-->

<!--TODO: Maybe check the wnt1 receptor and refer to the apical-mantle above.-->

The posteriormost Frizzled-expressing territory in *T. transversa* is a
distinct band of *fz9/10* immediately posterior to the mantle lobe. Wnt ligands
here are expressed in partially overlapping domains, but covering subregions.
*wnt1* for instance occupies the ventral and lateral portion, while *wnt6* is
on the dorsal side. Here again we observe the same arrangement of *wnt1* and
*wnt7* as present in the apical-mantle lobe boundary. We observe a similar or

with the *fz9/10* territories during *T. transversa* gastrulation is rather

receptor.

<!--TODO: Check interaction between wnt1 and wnt7 and fz9/10.-->

<!--TODO: Find out if any of these posterior genes have any role elsewhere.-->

Finally, at the posterior tip of the T. transversa embryo there is a
Frizzled-free zone where the ligands *wnt5*, *wnt6* and *wnt11* are expressed.
One possibility is that these genes are interacting with other co-receptors

<!--TODO: Look into wnt5, wnt6, and wnt11 posterior terminal expression.-->

Overall, the specific ligand-receptor combinations expressed along the
anteroposterior axis of T. transversa coincides with the major body regions and
their subregions. This suggests that the different ligand-receptor context can
be involved in setting up the identities or differentially patterning the
tissue fates of the different body regions of the brachiopod *T. transversa*.

## A highly modular Wnt signaling landscape in metazoans

If the ligand-receptor context plays a role in specifying different brachiopod
body regions, we wondered how conserved these transcriptional subregions are
among other animals. Unfortunately, the spatial Wnt expression data in the
brachiopod *L. anatina* is limited, so we first compare to other spiralians.

In the annelid *Platynereis dumerilii* we find several correspondent, putative
homologous Wnt expression domains with *T. transversa*, despite the great
differences in embryo architecture -- the annelid has fewer cells than the
brachiopod at the moment of gastrulation [@Cho2010-eb; @Janssen2010-dc]. For
instance, the expression of Frizzled receptors in *P. dumerilii* are mostly
similar to what we find in the brachiopod, following the same anteroposterior
arrangement [@Bastin2015-oz]. We can also identify Wnt ligands with comparable
expression domains. For example, the posterior expression of *wnt1* and the
anterior domain of *wnt2* are similar [@Prudhomme2003-lu; @Dray2010-op;
@Janssen2010-dc; @Pruitt2014-oy]. However, the spatial arrangement of some Wnt
ligands are clearly not conserved between *T. transversa* and *P. dumerilii*.
Data is still lacking from other spiralians specially from early stages that
have not been described. 

<!--TODO: Make a proper comparison for the domains.-->

<!--TODO: Which other spiralian can I compare to?-->

<!--TODO: Deuterostome (hemichordate) comparison, common domains.-->

The expression of Wnt genes in Ecdysozoa reveals that some domains are
comparable [@refs]. However, in the priapulid Priapulus caudatus most Wnt genes
are expressed at the posterior region of the embryo [@Hogvall2019]. Expression
of Wnt ligands in Drosophila and other arthropods show similarities. However,
the Frizzled domains do not entirely match what we find in *T. transversa*
[@refs]. *D. melanogaster* fz2 expression, orthologous to *T. transversa* fz5/8
is not expressed apically, but in the trunk, similar to T. transversa fz9/10
[@refs]. In addition, arthropods lost many Wnt ligands in specific lineages
complicating the identification of common or divergent ligand-receptor contexts
[@refs].

<!--TODO: Research better and find some examples of comparable domains.-->

<!--TODO: Are the Frizzled domains conserved, at least?-->

In the deuterostomes, however, the Wnt signaling landscape of hemichordates has
been analyzed in detail [@Darras2018-gm], and thus allow for a more complete
comparison to the brachiopod findings. The spatial arrangement of Frizzled
domains is quite similar between *T. transversa* and *Saccoglossus kowalevskii*
(@fig:comparative). In a closer comparison, we can also identify that many Wnt
ligands are also expressed in similar positions along the anteroposterior axis
of the two species (@fig:comparative). However, there is also differences.

<!--TODO: Cite other hemichordate papers?-->

![Comparative Wnt signaling ligand-receptor landscape between *T. transversa*
and .*S. kowalevskii*. Broad receptor territories are essentially the same
along the anteroposterior axis. There are common ligand-receptor combinations
between the two animals forming unique transcriptional regions in the embryo
that corresponds to differentiated body
regions.](figures/comparative.png){#fig:comparative width=100%}

<!--TODO: Are these microregions conserved in other animals?-->

By compiling the patterns, we can identify a common set of ligand-receptor
territories that are similar between brachiopods and hemichordates
(@fig:comparative). These are the anterior *fz1/2/7*+*fz4* domains with *wnt2*,
*wnt5* and *wnt8*, the head-trunk boundary expressing fz1/2/7+fz9/10 and
*wnt1*, the anterior portion of the trunk expressing *wnt16*, the posterior
trunk expressing *fz9/10* and *wnt10*, and the Frizzled-free posterior zone
expressing *wnt6*. These combinations can be merely coincidental, and more data
is needed to check if these unique regions occur in other bilaterians.

<!--TODO: Fetch relevant data for comparison.-->

Comparing to other deuterostomes such as echinoderms [@Robert2014-xj],
ascidians, amphioxus and vertebrates shows that Frizzled territories are
conserved [@refs]. We can also identify some ligand-receptor context that
appear often [@refs] and some others not.

Finally, when we put into a metazoan context, some recapitulate the expression
in cnidarians where arrangement of the ancestral Wnt ligands is not that
different [@refs]. However, the data on Frizzled is lacking. But the global
picture of Wnt signaling landscape is similar to hemichordates.

Overall, the emerging picture is that these molecular territories can
follow the same arrangement, the morphological boundaries demarcate body
regions can differ from group to group.

<!--For example, that is the case for the apical-mantle boundary and the collar-trunk boundary as the head-trunk boundary. These boundaries occur at the interface of different molecular contexts.-->

<!--TODO: Collect more convincing references.-->

## Wnt ligand-receptor context is key for patterning axial diversity

A common consensus is that axial patterning genes of bilaterians are conserved
and inherited from the last common ancestor [@refs]. The similar arrangement of
our Wnt signaling patterning data support this view. The discovery of multiple
wnt genes, their crucial developmental roles and their complex expression
domains has raised ideas about a wnt code [@Guder2006-fu]. An idea that
different Wnts can pattern and specify different body regions according to
their combinatorial territories.

First, the finding that wnt ligands are not long- but short-ranged signaling
activity [@Loh2016-pz]. The consequence is that wnt function is more local and
allow for more complex patterning outcomes. Second, the idea that is not a
specific wnt ligand that mediate specific signaling, but that the receptor
context dictates the Wnt signaling outcome [@Loh2016-pz]. This implies that the
same ligand can trigger different outcomes based on the receptor it binds to.
This put a greater importance when studying Wnt signaling on analyzing the
receptor context in conjunction to ligands. Therefore, accumulated evidence
reveals that the Wnt system is much more imbricated modular and multifunctional
than the Hox patterning.

<!--TODO: Develop better the final argument.-->

In that case, evolution might have tinkered with downstream regulators, genes
activated by the Wnt signaling pathway to generate different morphological
outcomes during anteroposterior patterning, as we observed in the examples
above. Therefore, the intricacy, pleiotropy, redundancy, modularity of the Wnt
signaling system might have paved the way and been crucial for the evolution of
bilaterian diversity.

The complex arrangements of wnt expression domains along the anteroposterior of
different animals suggests they might play a key patterning role. Since it is
at this point that major morphological features are specified, understanding
the roles of Wnts is crucial to understand the evolution of animal morphology.
However, given the recent developments on wnt signaling, we will not manage by
only looking at ligands. Thus it is crucial to consider the unique combination
of ligand-receptor frizzled and other receptors in future comparative studies.
