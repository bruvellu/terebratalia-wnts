  abstract = "WNT signaling is, in all multicellular animals, an essential
              intercellular communication pathway that is critical for shaping
              the embryo. At the molecular level, WNT signals can be
              transmitted by several transduction cascades, all activated
              chiefly by the binding of WNT ligands to receptors of the
              FRIZZLED family. The first step in assessing the biological
              functions of WNT signaling during embryogenesis is thus the
              establishment of the spatiotemporal expression profiles of wnt
              and frizzled genes in the course of embryonic development. To
              this end, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Northern
              blot, and in situ hybridization assays, we report here the
              comprehensive expression patterns of all 11 wnt and 4 frizzled
              genes present in the genome of the sea urchin Paracentrotus
              lividus during its embryogenesis. Our findings indicate that the
              expression of these wnt ligands and frizzled receptors is highly
              dynamic in both time and space. We further establish that all wnt
              genes are chiefly transcribed in the vegetal hemisphere of the
              embryo, whereas expression of the frizzled genes is distributed
              more widely across the embryonic territories. Thus, in P.
              lividus, WNT ligands might act both as short- and long-range
              signaling molecules that may operate in all cell lineages and
              tissues to control various developmental processes during
              embryogenesis. genesis 52:235-250. Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

              larvae of the articulate brachiopod Terebratalia transversa has
              been examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
              The mantle begins to form approximately 2 days after
              fertilization and subsequently develops into a skirtlike lobe
              that encircles the middle region of the larval body. A simple
              epithelium covers both the outer surface of the mantle lobe and
              the inner side situated next to the pedicle lobe of the larva.
              During metamorphosis, the mantle lobe is everted over the
              anterior end of the larva. Thus, the epithelium covering the
              outer part of the mantle lobe in the larva subsequently becomes
              the inner epithelium of the juvenile mantle. Similarly, the inner
              epithelium of the larval mantle lobe represents the future outer
              epithelium of the juvenile mantle. In free-swimming larvae, the
              prospective outer mantle epithelium contains two types of cells,
              called ``lobate'' and ``vesicular'' cells. Lobate cells initially
              deposit a thin layer of amorphous material, and vesicular cells
              produce ovoid multigranular bodies. Following settlement at about
              5 days postfertilization, the vesicular cells secrete an
              electron-dense sheet that constitutes the basal layer of the
              developing periostracum. Within several hours to a day
              thereafter, reversal of the mantle lobe is rapidly effected,
              apparently by contractions of the pedicle adjustor muscles.",

  abstract = "Recent structural analyses of invertebrate nervous systems have
              supported hypotheses stating that specific developmental and
              cytological aspects of larval and adult brains are conserved
              among bilaterian animals. Opposing views argue that structural
              similarities in larval nervous systems may be the result of
              convergent evolution and that the developmental diversity of
              adult brains is more indicative of several independent origins.
              Here, I use various cytological probes, confocal microscopy, and
              reconstruction techniques to investigate the cellular diversity
              within the larval nervous systems of Glottidia pyramidata and
              Terebratalia transversa (Brachiopoda). Neuronal cell types are
              compared among the rhynchonelliform, linguliform, and craniiform
              brachiopods as well as the phoronids. Although the respective
              larval types of the previously mentioned systematic groups
              clearly diverge in the neuroarchitecture of their larval apical
              organs (and nervous systems in general), a ground plan is
              proposed based on shared, centrally-located, peptidergic neuronal
              cell types that can be compared with similar cell types in other
              lophotrochozoan phyla (bryozoans and spiralians). Assessing
              hierarchal levels of homology within and among the nervous

              many phyla share early developmental signals that induce the
              specification of the neural ectoderm, clouding our ability to
              discern divergent larval and juvenile brain structure. Solving
              these problems will require a combined effort involving both
              traditional and more recent cytological techniques with a
              diversity of molecular probes that will better map the neuronal

              Terebratalia transversa has been examined by isolating animal,
              vegetal, and lateral halves at developmental stages ranging from
              prior to fertilization through late gastrula. Animal halves
              isolated from prior to fertilization through late blastula stages
              did not gastrulate and did not form endoderm. When these animal
              halves were isolated from prior to fertilization through early
              blastula, they formed only ciliated vesicles; however, similar
              halves from late blastulae frequently formed the ectodermal
              components of the three larval lobes. Vegetal halves isolated
              prior to fertilization through late blastula gastrulated, formed
              endoderm, and differentiated most larval structures; however,
              comparable isolates from late gastrulae showed a marked decline
              in the ability to form anterior larval structures. Animal halves
              isolated at this stage showed a corresponding decline in the
              ability to form posterior larval structures. These results
              indicate that during oogenesis, regional differences arise so
              that the animal half of the oocyte has a much greater ability to
              form anterior ectodermal structures than do other regions of the
              oocyte, while only the vegetal region has the capacity to
              gastrulate. Inductive signals produced by the vegetal region of
              the embryo act on the animal half to give it the capacity to form
              ectodermal components of the three larval lobes. This
              vegetal-inductive influence has played a major role in regional
              specification by the late blastula stage of development. Pairs of
              lateral halves isolated from the same oocyte or embryo from prior
              to fertilization through late blastula frequently gastrulate,
              form endoderm, and proceed to form all or most of the larval
              lobes. The late blastula is the first developmental stage where
              there is a marked decline in the ability of pairs of lateral
              halves to differentiate larval structures and is the first stage
              where pairs of halves resembling dorsal and ventral halves
              appear. This suggests that the axis of bilateral symmetry is also
              specified by the late blastula stage of development.",

              AmphiWnt5, and AmphiWnt6) and show that their early expression
              around the blastopore can subsequently be traced into the tail
              bud; in vertebrate embryos, there is a similar progression of
              expression domains for Wnt3, Wnt5, and Wnt6 genes from the

              AmphiWnt3, AmphiWnt5, and AmphiWnt6 are each expressed in a

               So far, it seemed that engrailed had been co-opted uniquely for
               this particular process in molluscs. Here, we show that, in the
               gastropod mollusc Patella vulgata, an engrailed ortholog is
               expressed in the edge of the embryonic shell and in the anlage

               cell polarity (PCP), a Wnt pathway that signals through the

               events, including axis specification, gastrulation, and limb,
               heart, or neural development. The three major Wnt pathways are
               activated by ligands, the Wnts, which clearly belong to the same
               gene family. However, their signal is then mediated by three
               separate sets of extracellular, cytoplasmic, and nuclear
               components that are pathway-specific and that distinguish each
               of them. Homologs of the Wnt genes and of the Wnt pathways
               components have been discovered in many eukaryotic model systems
               and functional investigations have been carried out for most of
               them. This review extracts available data on the Wnt pathways,
               from the protist Dictyostelium discoideum to humans, and
               provides from an evolutionary prospective the overall molecular
               and functional conservation of the three Wnt pathways and their
               activators throughout the eukaryotic superkingdom.",

               Terebratalia transversa has been examined by electron
               microscopy. The posterior half of the free-swimming larva
               comprises a non-ciliated pedicle lobe that contains the
               primordium of the juvenile pedicle at its distal end. During
               settlement at five to six days post-fertilization, the pedicle
               lobe secretes a sticky sheet that attaches the larva to the
               substratum. As metamorphosis proceeds, the epithelium in the
               posterior half of the pedicle lobe produces a thin overlying
               cuticle, and the pedicle primordium develops into a stalk-like
               anchoring organ. The juvenile pedicle protrudes through the gape
               that occurs between the posterior margins of the shell valves. A
               cup-like canopy, called the pedicle capsule, lines the posterior
               end of the shell and surrounds the newly formed pedicle. The
               core of the juvenile pedicle is filled with a solid mass of
               connective tissue. Numerous tonofibrils occur in the pedicle
               epithelium, and the overlying cuticle consists of amorphous
               material covered by a thin granular fringe. By one year
               post-metamorphosis, a body cavity develops anterior to the
               pedicle. Two pairs of adjustor muscles extend from the posterior
               end of the shell and traverse the cavity to insert in the
               pedicle. The connective tissue core of the pedicle in sub-adult
               specimens lacks muscle cells but contains numerous fibroblasts
               and collagen fibers. Three regions are recognizable in the
               connective tissue compartment of the adult pedicle: a
               subepithelial layer of non-fibrous connective tissue, a central
               fibrous zone, and a proximal mass of tissue that resembles
               cartilage.",

  abstract = "Posterior elongation of the developing embryo is a common feature
              of animal development. One group of genes that is involved in
              posterior elongation is represented by the Wnt genes, secreted
              glycoprotein ligands that signal to specific receptors on
              neighbouring cells and thereby establish cell-to-cell
              communication. In segmented animals such as annelids and
              arthropods, Wnt signalling is also likely involved in segment
              border formation and regionalisation of the segments. Priapulids
              represent unsegmented worms that are distantly related to
              arthropods. Despite their interesting phylogenetic position and
              their importance for the understanding of ecdysozoan evolution,
              priapulids still represent a highly underinvestigated group of
              animals. Here, we study the embryonic expression patterns of the
              complete sets of Wnt genes in the priapulids Priapulus caudatus
              and Halicryptus spinulosus. We find that both priapulids possess
              a complete set of 12 Wnt genes. At least in Priapulus, most of
              these genes are expressed in and around the posterior-located
              blastopore and thus likely play a role in posterior elongation.
              Together with previous work on the expression of other genetic
              factors such as caudal and even-skipped, this suggests that
              posterior elongation in priapulids is under control of the same
              (or very similar) conserved gene regulatory network as in
              arthropods.",

  abstract  = "Several lines of evidence suggest that Wnt genes play a critical
               role in regulating development of the vertebrate embryo. To
               address the role that this family may play in the development of
               the chicken central nervous system (CNS), we have used a PCR
               based strategy to clone partial sequences for Wnt genes. At
               least six different Wnt genes are expressed in the developing
               CNS of the chick embryo. The domains of expression overlap
               either partially or completely, and are expressed in spatial
               domains that prefigure morphological subunits of the embryonic
               neural tube. Wnt-1 and Wnt-4 are first expressed in the open
               neural plate in the region of the presumptive mesencephalon.
               Wnt-3a expression is first observed in the rhombencephalic
               regions of the open neural plate. After neural tube closure,
               when the embryonic subdivisions of the neural tube became
               apparent, Wnt-1, Wnt-3a and Wnt-4 are all broadly expressed in
               partially overlapping domains in the mesencephalon and caudal
               diencephalon, as well as in the rhombencephalon and spinal cord.
               The mesencephalic expression patterns are subsequently modified
               such that Wnt-1 and Wnt-4 are expressed in a characteristic ring
               just rostral to the isthmus, at the mesencephalic/metencephalic
               junction; and Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a expression become restricted to
               the dorsal midline. Wnt-1, Wnt-3a, Wnt-4, Wnt-5a and Wnt-8b are
               expressed in one or two caudal subdivisions of the developing
               diencephalon, the synencephalon and posterior parencephalon, but
               do not extend ventral to the zona limitans interparencephalica.
               In contrast, Wnt-7b is expressed in the anterior parencephalon.
               Both Wnt-7b and Wnt-8b are expressed in telencephalic portions
               of the secondary prosencephalon. The timing and spatial
               distribution of Wnt-gene expression in the chick embryo further

               establishes PCP in a three-dimensional tissue or organ with
               respect to the body axes remains elusive. In vertebrate, while
               Wnt-secreted signaling molecules have been implicated in

               processes, from cleavage to patterning and cell migration. There
               are 13 subfamilies of Wnt ligand genes and this diverse
               repertoire appeared very early in metazoan evolution. In this
               review, we first summarise the known Wnt gene repertoire in
               various arthropods. Insects appear to have lost several Wnt
               subfamilies, either generally, such as Wnt3, or in lineage
               specific patterns, for example, the loss of Wnt7 in Anopheles.
               In Drosophila and Acyrthosiphon, only seven and six Wnt
               subfamilies are represented, respectively; however, the finding
               of nine Wnt genes in Tribolium suggests that arthropods had a
               larger repertoire ancestrally. We then discuss what is currently
               known about the expression and developmental function of Wnt
               ligands in Drosophila and other insects in comparison to other
               arthropods, such as the spiders Achaearanea and Cupiennius. We
               conclude that studies of Wnt genes have given us much insight
               into the developmental roles of some of these ligands. However,
               given the frequent loss of Wnt genes in insects and the derived

              receptor Frizzled and prevents the constitutive destruction of
              cytosolic beta-catenin. In the non-canonical Wnt pathways such as
              Wnt-Frizzled/PCP (planar cell polarity) signaling, Dvl signals
              via the Daam1-RhoA axis and the Rac1 axis. In addition, Dvl plays

              developmental genetics. In particular, a similar extensive
              morphological segmentation (or metamerism) is commonly recognized
              in annelids and arthropods. Mostly based on this supposedly
              homologous segmentation, these phyla have been united for a long
              time into the clade Articulata. However, recent phylogenetic
              analysis dismissed the Articulata and thus challenged the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Embryonic patterning mechanisms regulate the
              cytoskeletal machinery that drives morphogenesis, but there are
              few cases where links between patterning mechanisms and
              morphogenesis are well understood. We have used a combination of
              genetics, in vivo imaging, and cell manipulations to identify
              such links in C. elegans gastrulation. Gastrulation in C. elegans
              begins with the internalization of endodermal precursor cells in
              a process that depends on apical constriction of ingressing
              cells. RESULTS: We show that ingression of the endodermal
              precursor cells is regulated by pathways, including a
              Wnt-Frizzled signaling pathway, that specify endodermal cell
              fate. We find that Wnt signaling has a role in gastrulation in
              addition to its earlier roles in regulating endodermal cell fate
              and cell-cycle timing. In the absence of Wnt signaling,
              endodermal precursor cells polarize and enrich myosin II apically
              but fail to contract their apical surfaces. We show that a
              regulatory myosin light chain normally becomes phosphorylated on
              the apical side of ingressing cells at a conserved site that can
              lead to myosin-filament formation and contraction of actomyosin
              networks and that this phosphorylation depends on Wnt signaling.
              CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Wnt signaling regulates C. elegans
              gastrulation through regulatory myosin light-chain
              phosphorylation, which results in the contraction of the apical
              surface of ingressing cells. These findings forge new links
              between cell-fate specification and morphogenesis, and they
              represent a novel mechanism by which Wnt signaling can regulate
              morphogenesis.",

               ``canonical'' Wnt signaling pathway, which activates target
               genes in a complex with TCF (LEF) transcription factors [1]. In
               many metazoans, embryos are first subdivided during early
               cleavage stages into nuclear Î²-catenin-positive and -negative
               domains, with Î²-catenin specifying endoderm or mesendoderm fate.
               This process has been demonstrated in a wide range of phyla
               including cnidarians, nemerteans, and invertebrate deuterostomes
               (echinoderms, hemichordates, and ascidians), implying that
               Î²-catenin-dependent (mes)endoderm specification is

               to the segregation of mesoderm and endoderm fates from a

               (i.e., articulate) brachiopod Terebratalia transversa. Not is a
               homeobox containing gene that regulates the formation of the
               notochord in chordates, while Cdx (caudal) is a ParaHox gene
               involved in the formation of posterior tissues of various animal
               phyla. The T. transversa homolog, TtrNot, is expressed in the
               ectoderm from the beginning of gastrulation until completion of
               larval development, which is marked by a three-lobed body with
               larval setae. Expression starts at gastrulation in two areas
               lateral to the blastopore and subsequently extends over the
               animal pole of the gastrula. With elongation of the gastrula,
               expression at the animal pole narrows to a small band, whereas
               the areas lateral to the blastopore shift slightly towards the
               future anterior region of the larva. Upon formation of the three
               larval body lobes, TtrNot expressing cells are present only in
               the posterior part of the apical lobe. Expression ceases
               entirely at the onset of larval setae formation. TtrNot
               expression is absent in unfertilized eggs, in embryos prior to
               gastrulation, and in settled individuals during and after
               metamorphosis. Comparison with the expression patterns of Not

               this gene in gastrulation and germ layer (ectoderm)
               specification with co-opted functions in notochord formation in
               chordates and left/right determination in ambulacrarians and

               the ectoderm of the gastrulating embryo in the posterior region
               of the blastopore. Its expression stays stable in that domain
               until the blastopore is closed. Thereafter, the expression is
               confined to the ventral portion of the mantle lobe in the fully
               developed larva. No TtrCdx expression is detectable in the
               juvenile after metamorphosis. This expression of TtrCdx is
               congruent with findings in other metazoans, where genes
               belonging to the Cdx/caudal family are predominantly localized
               in posterior domains during gastrulation. Later in development

               signaling cascades, canonical (Î²-catenin), calcium, or planar

               analyzed their expression patterns during amphioxus

               expressed and might be involved in early animal-vegetal axis
               establishment. The AmphiFz1/2/7 transcripts were detected in the
               central dorsal neural plate, mesoderm, the Hatschek's pit, and
               rim of the mouth, whereas those of AmphiFz4 were detected in the
               mesoderm, pharyngeal endoderm, and entire gut region. AmphiFz5/8
               was exclusively expressed in the anterior-most region, whereas
               AmphiFz9/10 was expressed in the neural plate, somites, and tail

              cell divisions in a wide array of metazoans. The nemertean worm,
              Cerebratulus lacteus, represents a member of the understudied
              lophotrochozoan clade that exhibits a highly stereotyped spiral
              cleavage program in which ectodermal, endodermal, and mesodermal
              origins are known from intracellular fate mapping studies. Here,
              the embryonic distribution of beta-catenin protein was studied
              using injection of synthetic mRNA, encoding GFP-tagged
              beta-catenin, into fertilized eggs. During the early cleavage
              stages beta-catenin was destabilized/degraded in animal
              hemisphere blastomeres and became localized to the nuclei of the
              four vegetal-most cells at the 64-cell stage, which give rise to
              definitive larval and adult endoderm. Functional assays indicate
              that beta-catenin plays a key role in the development of the
              endoderm. Morpholino knockdown of endogenous beta-catenin, as
              confirmed by Western analysis, resulted in the failure to
              gastrulate, absence of the gut and an animalized phenotype in the
              resulting larvae, including the formation of ectopic (anterior)
              apical organ tissue with elongated apical tuft cilia and no
              indications of dorsoventral polarity. Similarly, over-expression
              of the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin or a beta-catenin-engrailed
              repressor fusion construct prevented endoderm formation and
              generated the same animalized phenotype. Injections of mRNA
              encoding either a stabilized, constitutively activated form of
              beta-catenin or a dominant negative form of GSK3-beta converted
              all or nearly all cells into endodermal fates expressing
              gut-specific esterase. Thus, beta-catenin appears to be both

              formation in anthozoan cnidarians, ascidians, and echinoderms.
              Consistent with the results of other studies, beta-catenin may be
              viewed as playing a role in the development of posterior/vegetal
              larval fates (i.e., endoderm) in C. lacteus. However, unlike the
              case found in polychaete annelid and soil nematode embryos, there
              is no evidence for a role of beta-catenin in regulating cell
              fates and asymmetric cell divisions along the entire

              Although many of the genes involved in the specification of cell
              identity during this process have been identified, little is
              known of the genes that coordinate cell movement. Here we show
              that the zebrafish silberblick (slb) locus encodes Wnt11 and that
              Slb/Wnt11 activity is required for cells to undergo correct
              convergent extension movements during gastrulation. In the
              absence of Slb/Wnt11 function, abnormal extension of axial tissue
              results in cyclopia and other midline defects in the head. The
              requirement for Slb/Wnt11 is cell non-autonomous, and our results

              partly dependent on medio-lateral cell intercalation in paraxial

              Despite its significance, the evolution of this metazoan-specific

              were defined, of which only six have counterparts in Ecdysozoa

              sister-group to bilaterian metazoans. Phylogenetic analyses of N.

  abstract  = "Planar cell polarity (PCP) is an essential feature of animal
               tissues, whereby distinct polarity is established within the
               plane of a cell sheet. Tissue-wide establishment of PCP is
               driven by multiple global cues, including gradients of gene
               expression, gradients of secreted WNT ligands and anisotropic
               tissue strain. These cues guide the dynamic, subcellular
               enrichment of PCP proteins, which can self-assemble into
               mutually exclusive complexes at opposite sides of a cell.
               Endocytosis, endosomal trafficking and degradation dynamics of
               PCP components further regulate planar tissue patterning. This
               polarization propagates throughout the whole tissue, providing a
               polarity axis that governs collective morphogenetic events such
               as the orientation of subcellular structures and cell
               rearrangements. Reflecting the necessity of polarized cellular
               behaviours for proper development and function of diverse
               organs, defects in PCP have been implicated in human
               pathologies, most notably in severe birth defects.",

               this distinction preluded the classification of bilaterian

               major scenarios of bilaterian evolution, the developmental basis

              represent a superphylum that is crucial to our understanding of
              bilaterian evolution. However, given the inconsistency of
              molecular and morphological data for these groups, their origins
              have been unclear. Here, we present draft genomes of the
              nemertean Notospermus geniculatus and the phoronid Phoronis
              australis, together with transcriptomes along the adult bodies.
              Our genome-based phylogenetic analyses place Nemertea sister to
              the group containing Phoronida and Brachiopoda. We show that
              lophotrochozoans share many gene families with deuterostomes,

              repertoire that ecdysozoans (for example, flies and nematodes)
              and platyzoans (for example, flatworms and rotifers) do not.
              Comparative transcriptomics demonstrates that lophophores of

              head patterning, although different heads evolved independently

              has identified the canonical Wnt pathway in the freshwater polyp
              Hydra, where it acts in organizer formation and regeneration. Wnt
              signalling is also essential for cnidarian embryogenesis. In the
              sea anemone Nematostella vectensis 11 of the 12 known wnt gene
              subfamilies were identified. Different wnt genes exhibit serial
              and overlapping expression domains along the oral-aboral axis of
              the embryo (the 'wnt code'). This is reminiscent of the hox code

  abstract = "In sea urchin embryos, the animal-vegetal axis is specified
              during oogenesis. After fertilization, this axis is patterned to
              produce five distinct territories by the 60-cell stage.
              Territorial specification is thought to occur by a signal
              transduction cascade that is initiated by the large micromeres
              located at the vegetal pole. The molecular mechanisms that
              mediate the specification events along the animalâvegetal axis in
              sea urchin embryos are largely unknown. Nuclear Î²-catenin is seen
              in vegetal cells of the early embryo, suggesting that this
              protein plays a role in specifying vegetal cell fates. Here, we
              test this hypothesis and show that Î²-catenin is necessary for
              vegetal plate specification and is also sufficient for endoderm
              formation. In addition, we show that Î²-catenin has pronounced
              effects on animal blastomeres and is critical for specification
              of aboral ectoderm and for ectoderm patterning, presumably via a
              noncell-autonomous mechanism. These results support a model in
              which a Wnt-like signal released by vegetal cells patterns the
              early embryo along the animalâvegetal axis. Our results also
              reveal similarities between the sea urchin animalâvegetal axis
              and the vertebrate dorsalâventral axis, suggesting that these
              axes share a common evolutionary origin.",

               involvement of this pathway in lung tumorigenesis has not been
               established. In this study, analysis of multiple Wnt mRNAs in
               non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and primary lung
               tumors revealed markedly decreased Wnt-7a expression compared
               with normal short-term bronchial epithelial cell lines and
               normal uninvolved lung tissue. Wnt-7a transfection in NSCLC cell
               lines reversed cellular transformation, decreased
               anchorage-independent growth, and induced epithelial
               differentiation as demonstrated by soft agar and
               three-dimensional cell culture assays in a subset of the NSCLC
               cell lines. The action of Wnt-7a correlated with expression of
               the specific Wnt receptor Frizzled-9 (Fzd-9), and transfection
               of Fzd-9 into a Wnt-7a-insensitive NSCLC cell line established
               Wnt-7a sensitivity. Moreover, Wnt-7a was present in Fzd-9
               immunoprecipitates, indicating a direct interaction of Wnt-7a
               and Fzd-9. In NSCLC cells, Wnt-7a and Fzd-9 induced both
               cadherin and Sprouty-4 expression and stimulated the JNK

               tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sprouty-4 and represents a novel tumor

  author   = "Talavera, Gerard and Castresana, Jose",
  abstract = "Alignment quality may have as much impact on phylogenetic
              reconstruction as the phylogenetic methods used. Not only the
              alignment algorithm, but also the method used to deal with the
              most problematic alignment regions, may have a critical effect on
              the final tree. Although some authors remove such problematic
              regions, either manually or using automatic methods, in order to
              improve phylogenetic performance, others prefer to keep such
              regions to avoid losing any information. Our aim in the present
              work was to examine whether phylogenetic reconstruction improves
              after alignment cleaning or not. Using simulated protein
              alignments with gaps, we tested the relative performance in
              diverse phylogenetic analyses of the whole alignments versus the
              alignments with problematic regions removed with our previously
              developed Gblocks program. We also tested the performance of more
              or less stringent conditions in the selection of blocks.
              Alignments constructed with different alignment methods
              (ClustalW, Mafft, and Probcons) were used to estimate
              phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and
              parsimony. We show that, in most alignment conditions, and for
              alignments that are not too short, removal of blocks leads to
              better trees. That is, despite losing some information, there is
              an increase in the actual phylogenetic signal. Overall, the best
              trees are obtained by maximum-likelihood reconstruction of
              alignments cleaned by Gblocks. In general, a relaxed selection of
              blocks is better for short alignment, whereas a stringent
              selection is more adequate for longer ones. Finally, we show that
              cleaned alignments produce better topologies although,
              paradoxically, with lower bootstrap. This indicates that
              divergent and problematic alignment regions may lead, when
              present, to apparently better supported although, in fact, more
              biased topologies.",

              functional classes of Wnt during vertebrate development, this
              raises the question of how the signaling pathways of these
              classes of Wnts might interact. To address this issue, we
              coexpressed various Xwnts and components of the Wnt-1 class
              signaling pathway in developing Xenopus embryos. Members of the
              Xwnt-5A class antagonized the ability of ectopic Wnt-1 class to
              induce goosecoid expression and a secondary axis. Interestingly,
              the Wnt-5A class did not block goosecoid expression or axis
              induction in response to overexpression of cytoplasmic components
              of the Wnt-1 signaling pathway, beta-catenin or a kinase-dead
              gsk-3, or to the unrelated secreted factor, BVg1. The ability of
              the Wnt-5A class to block responses to the Wnt-1 class may
              involve decreases in cell adhesion, since ectopic expression of
              Xwnt-5A leads to decreased Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion and the
              activity of Xwnt-5A to block Wnt-1 class signals is mimicked by a
              dominant negative N-cadherin. These data underscore the
              importance of cell adhesion in modulating the responses of
              embryonic cells to signaling molecules and suggest that the
              Wnt-5A functional class of signaling factors can interact with

               but how they activate the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is
               not clear. Here we use three distinct vertebrate frizzled
               receptors (Xfz3, Xfz4 and Xfz7) and describe whether and how
               their C-terminal cytoplasmic regions transduce the
               Wnt/beta-catenin signal. We show that Xfz3 activates this
               pathway in the absence of exogenous ligands, while Xfz4 and Xfz7
               interact with Xwnt5A to activate this pathway. Analysis using
               chimeric receptors reveals that their C-terminal cytoplasmic
               regions are functionally equivalent in Wnt/beta-catenin
               signalling. Furthermore, a conserved motif (Lys-Thr-X-X-X-Trp)
               located two amino acids after the seventh transmembrane domain
               is required for activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and

               Frizzled receptors with point mutations affecting either of the
               three conserved residues are defective in Wnt/beta-catenin

               supporting a role of this conserved motif in the modulation of

              these characters onto the phylogenetic framework, we can detect
              changes that have occurred in them during evolution. The spiral
              mode of development is a complex of characters that is present in
              many lineages, such as nemerteans, annelids, mollusks, and
              polyclad platyhelminthes. However, some of these lineages show
              variations of this general program in which sub-characters are
              modified without changing the overlying pattern. Recent molecular
              phylogenies suggest that spiral cleavage was lost, or at least
              has deviated from its original pattern, in more lineages than was
              previously thought (e.g., in rotifers, gastrotrichs, bryozoans,

              Neuropeptides and their receptors underwent extensive
              diversification in bilaterians and the relationships of many
              peptide-receptor systems have been clarified. However, we lack a
              detailed picture of neuropeptide evolution in lophotrochozoans as
              in-depth studies only exist for molluscs and annelids. Here we
              analyse peptidergic systems in Nemertea, Brachiopoda and
              Phoronida. We screened transcriptomes from thirteen nemertean,
              six brachiopod and four phoronid species for proneuropeptides and
              neuropeptide GPCRs. With mass spectrometry from the nemertean
              Lineus longissimus, we validated several predicted peptides and
              identified novel ones. Molecular phylogeny combined with
              peptide-sequence and gene-structure comparisons allowed us to
              comprehensively map spiralian neuropeptide evolution. We found
              most mollusc and annelid peptidergic systems also in nemerteans,
              brachiopods and phoronids. We uncovered previously hidden
              relationships including the orthologies of spiralian CCWamides to
              arthropod agatoxin-like peptides and of mollusc APGWamides to
              RGWamides from annelids, with orthologues systems in nemerteans,
              brachiopods and phoronids. We found that pleurin neuropeptides

              and brachiopods. We also identified cases of gene family
              duplications and losses. These include a protostome-specific
              expansion of RFamide/Wamide signalling, a spiralian expansion of
              GnRH-related peptides, and duplications of vasopressin/oxytocin
              before the divergence of brachiopods, phoronids and nemerteans.
              This analysis expands our knowledge of peptidergic signalling in
              spiralians and other protostomes. Our annotated dataset of nearly
              1,300 proneuropeptide sequences and 600 GPCRs presents a useful

               obtain a more comprehensive scenario of the evolutionary
               dynamics of this gene family, we exhaustively mined wnt gene
               sequences from the whole genome assemblies of a mollusk (Lottia
               gigantea) and two annelids (Capitella teleta and Helobdella
               robusta) and examined them by phylogenetic, genetic linkage,
               intron-exon structure, and embryonic expression analyses. The 36
               wnt genes obtained represent 11, 12, and 9 distinct wnt
               subfamilies in Lottia, Capitella, and Helobdella, respectively.
               Thus, two of the three analyzed lophotrochozoan genomes retained

               the importance and complexity of this gene family across

               significantly more dynamism than those of Lottia and Capitella,
               as judged by gene duplications and losses, branch length, and
               changes in genetic linkage. Finally, we performed a detailed
               expression analysis for all the Helobdella wnt genes during

               tissue morphogenesis. Comparisons of the embryonic expression
               patterns of the duplicated wnt genes in Helobdella with their

              sub-reactions and even ciliated larvae are able to coordinate
              sub-reactions of complex behaviours (metamorphosis, feeding). How
              these sub-reactions are coordinated is currently not well
              understood. Neuropeptides are potential candidates for triggering
              larval behaviour. However, although their immunoreactivity has
              been widely analysed, their function in trochozoan larvae has
              only been studied for a few cases. Here, we investigate the role
              of neuropeptides in the defence behaviour of brachiopod larvae.
              When mechanically disturbed, the planktonic larvae of
              Terebratalia transversa protrude their stiff chaetae and sink
              down slowly. We identified endogenous FLRFamide-type
              neuropeptides (AFLRFamide and DFLRFamide) in T. transversa larvae
              and show that the protrusion of the chaetae as well as the
              sinking reaction can both be induced by each of these peptides.
              This also correlates with the presence of FLRFamidergic neurons
              in the apical lobe and adjacent to the trunk musculature. We
              deorphanized the AFLRFamide/DFLRFamide receptor and detected its
              expression in the same tissues. Furthermore, the ability of
              native and modified FLRFamide-type peptides to activate this
              receptor was found to correspond with their ability to trigger

              developmental processes such as endomesoderm specification,
              gastrulation and patterning the main body axis. To activate the
              signal, Wnt ligands form complexes with LRP5/6 and Frizzled
              receptors, which leads to nuclear translocation of Î²-catenin and
              transcriptional response. In Bilateria, the expression of
              different Frizzled genes is often partially overlapping, and
              their functions are known to be redundant in several
              developmental contexts. Here we demonstrate that all four
              Frizzled receptors take part in the cWnt-mediated oral-aboral
              axis patterning in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis but show
              partially redundant functions. However, we do not see evidence
              for their involvement in the specification of the endoderm â an
              earlier event likely relying on maternal, intracellular Î²-catenin
              signaling components. Finally, we demonstrate that the main Wnt
              ligands crucial for the early oral-aboral patterning are Wnt3 and
              Wnt4. Comparison of our data to the knowledge from other models

  abstract = "Background Brachiopods and molluscs are lophotrochozoans with
              hard external shells which are often believed to have evolved
              convergently. While palaeontological data indicates that both
              groups are descended from biomineralising Cambrian ancestors, the
              closest relatives of brachiopods â phoronids and bryozoans â are
              mineralised to a much lower extent and are comparatively poorly
              represented in the Palaeozoic fossil record. Although brachiopod
              and mollusc shells are structurally analogous, genomic and
              proteomic evidence indicates that their formation involves a
              complement of conserved, orthologous genes. Here, we study a set
              of genes comprised of three homeodomain transcription factors,
              one signalling molecule and 6 structural proteins which are
              implicated in mollusc and brachiopod shell formation, search for
              their orthologs in transcriptomes or genomes of brachiopods,

              transversa, Lingula anatina, Novocrania anomala , the bryozoans
              Bugula neritina and Membranipora membranacea , and the phoronids
              Phoronis australis and Phoronopsis harmeri resulted in the
              recovery of orthologs of the majority of the genes in all taxa.
              While the full complement of genes was present in all brachiopods
              with a single exception in L. anatina , a bloc of four genes
              could consistently not be retrieved from bryozoans and phoronids.
              The genes engrailed, distal-less, ferritin, perlucin, sp1 and sp2
              were shown to be expressed in the biomineralising mantle margin
              of T. transversa juveniles. Conclusions The gene expression
              patterns we recovered indicate that while mineralised shells in
              brachiopods and molluscs are structurally analogous, their
              formation builds on a homologous process that involves a
              conserved complement of orthologous genes. Losses of some of the
              genes related to biomineralisation in bryozoans and phoronids
              indicate that loss of the capacity to form mineralised structures
              occurred already in the phoronid-bryozoan stem group and supports
              the idea that mineralised skeletons evolved secondarily in some
              of the bryozoan subclades. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement

              Wnt signaling is modulated by a number of evolutionarily

              (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics,
              the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very
              long queries or database sequences. There are also some
              shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line
              applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of
              rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line
              applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for
              processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run
              times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve
              only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and
              memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of
              contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking
              information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A
              new modular software library can now access subject sequence data

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The Wnt genes encode secreted glycoprotein ligands
               that regulate a wide range of developmental processes, including
               axis elongation and segmentation. There are thirteen subfamilies
               of Wnt genes in metazoans and this gene diversity appeared early
               in animal evolution. The loss of Wnt subfamilies appears to be
               common in insects, but little is known about the Wnt repertoire
               in other arthropods, and moreover the expression and function of
               these genes have only been investigated in a few protostomes
               outside the relatively Wnt-poor model species Drosophila
               melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. To investigate the
               evolution of this important gene family more broadly in
               protostomes, we surveyed the Wnt gene diversity in the
               crustacean Daphnia pulex, the chelicerates Ixodes scapularis and
               Achaearanea tepidariorum, the myriapod Glomeris marginata and
               the annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We also characterised Wnt
               gene expression in the latter three species, and further
               investigated expression of these genes in the beetle Tribolium
               castaneum. RESULTS: We found that Daphnia and Platynereis both
               contain twelve Wnt subfamilies demonstrating that the common
               ancestors of arthropods, ecdysozoans and protostomes possessed
               all members of all Wnt subfamilies except Wnt3. Furthermore,
               although there is striking loss of Wnt genes in insects, other
               arthropods have maintained greater Wnt gene diversity. The
               expression of many Wnt genes overlap in segmentally reiterated
               patterns and in the segment addition zone, and while these
               patterns can be relatively conserved among arthropods and the
               annelid, there have also been changes in the expression of some
               Wnt genes in the course of protostome evolution. Nevertheless,
               our results strongly support the parasegment as the primary
               segmental unit in arthropods, and suggest further similarities
               between segmental and parasegmental regulation by Wnt genes in
               annelids and arthropods respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite
               frequent losses of Wnt gene subfamilies in lineages such as
               insects, nematodes and leeches, most protostomes have probably
               maintained much of their ancestral repertoire of twelve Wnt
               genes. The maintenance of a large set of these ligands could be
               in part due to their combinatorial activity in various tissues
               rather than functional redundancy. The activity of such Wnt
               'landscapes' as opposed to the function of individual ligands
               could explain the patterns of conservation and redeployment of
               these genes in important developmental processes across
               metazoans. This requires further analysis of the expression and
               function of these genes in a wider range of taxa.",

              Brachiopoda remains one of the lophotrochozoan phyla for which no
              recent ontogenetic data employing modern methodologies such as
              fluorescence labelling and confocal microscopy are available.
              This is particularly astonishing given the ongoing controversy
              concerning its phylogenetic position. In order to contribute new
              morphogenetic data for phylogenetic and evolutionary inferences,
              we describe herein the ontogeny and myoanatomy of larvae and
              adults of the rhynchonelliform brachiopods Argyrotheca cordata,
              A. cistellula, and Terebratalia transversa using fluorescence
              F-actin labelling combined with confocal laserscanning
              microscopy. RESULTS: Fully grown larvae of A. cordata and T.
              transversa consist of three distinct body regions, namely an
              apical lobe, a mantle lobe with four bundles of setae, and a
              pedicle lobe. Myogenesis is very similar in these two species.
              The first anlagen of the musculature develop in the pedicle lobe,
              followed by setae muscles and the mantle lobe musculature.
              Late-stage larvae show a network of strong pedicle muscles,
              central mantle muscles, longitudinal muscles running from the
              mantle to the pedicle lobe, setae pouch muscles, setae muscles, a
              U-shaped muscle, serial mantle muscles, and apical longitudinal
              as well as apical transversal muscles. Fully developed A.
              cistellula larvae differ from the former species in that they
              have only two visible body lobes and lack setae. Nevertheless, we
              found corresponding muscle systems to all muscles present in the
              former two species, except for the musculature associated with
              the setae, in larvae of A. cistellula. With our survey of the
              adult myoanatomy of A. cordata and A. cistellula and the juvenile
              muscular architecture of T. transversa we confirm the presence of
              adductors, diductors, dorsal and ventral pedicle adjustors,
              mantle margin muscles, a distinct musculature of the intestine,
              and striated muscle fibres in the tentacles for all three
              species. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that larvae of
              rhynchonelliform brachiopods share a common muscular bodyplan and
              are thus derived from a common ancestral larval type. Comparison
              of the muscular phenotype of rhynchonelliform larvae to that of
              the other two lophophorate phyla, Phoronida and Ectoprocta, does
              not indicate homology of individual larval muscles. This may be
              due to an early evolutionary split of the ontogenetic pathways of
              Brachiopoda, Phoronida, and Ectoprocta that gave rise to the
              morphological diversity of these phyla.",

               signaling pathway, the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Molecular
               phylogenetic analysis shows four distinct Wnt ligands (MlWnt6,
               MlWnt9, MlWntA and MlWntX), and most, but not all components of
               the receptor and intracellular signaling pathway were detected.
               In situ hybridization of the four Wnt ligands showed that they
               are expressed in discrete regions associated with the aboral
               pole, tentacle apparati and apical organ. CONCLUSIONS:
               Ctenophores show a minimal (but not obviously simple) complement
               of Wnt signaling components. Furthermore, it is difficult to
               compare the Mnemiopsis Wnt expression patterns with those of
               other metazoans. mRNA expression of Wnt pathway components
               appears later in development than expected, and zygotic gene
               expression does not appear to play a role in early axis
               specification. Notably absent in the Mnemiopsis genome are most
               major secreted antagonists, which suggests that complex
               regulation of this secreted signaling pathway probably evolved
               later in animal evolution.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gastrulation is a uniquely metazoan character, and
              its genesis was arguably the key step that enabled the remarkable
              diversification within this clade. The process of gastrulation
              involves two tightly coupled events during embryogenesis of most
              metazoans. Morphogenesis produces a distinct internal epithelial
              layer in the embryo, and this epithelium becomes segregated as an
              endoderm/endomesodermal germ layer through the activation of a
              specific gene regulatory program. The developmental mechanisms
              that induced archenteron formation and led to the segregation of
              germ layers during metazoan evolution are unknown. But an
              increased understanding of development in early diverging taxa at
              the base of the metazoan tree may provide insights into the
              origins of these developmental mechanisms. RESULTS: In the
              anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, initial archenteron
              formation begins with bottle cell-induced buckling of the
              blastula epithelium at the animal pole. Here, we show that bottle
              cell formation and initial gut invagination in Nematostella
              requires NvStrabismus (NvStbm), a maternally-expressed core
              component of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway. The
              NvStbm protein is localized to the animal pole of the zygote,
              remains asymmetrically expressed through the cleavage stages, and
              becomes restricted to the apical side of invaginating bottle
              cells at the blastopore. Antisense morpholino-mediated
              NvStbm-knockdown blocks bottle cell formation and initial
              archenteron invagination, but it has no effect on Wnt/Ã-catenin
              signaling-mediated endoderm cell fate specification. Conversely,
              selectively blocking Wnt/Ã-catenin signaling inhibits endoderm
              cell fate specification but does not affect bottle cell formation
              and initial archenteron invagination. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              demonstrate that Wnt/PCP-mediated initial archenteron
              invagination can be uncoupled from Wnt/Ã-catenin-mediated
              endoderm cell fate specification in Nematostella, and provides
              evidence that these two processes could have evolved
              independently during metazoan evolution. We propose a two-step
              model for the evolution of an archenteron and the evolution of
              endodermal germ layer segregation. Asymmetric accumulation and
              activation of Wnt/PCP components at the animal pole of the last
              common ancestor to the eumetazoa may have induced the cell shape
              changes that led to the initial formation of an archenteron.
              Activation of Wnt/Ã-catenin signaling at the animal pole may have
              led to the activation of a gene regulatory network that specified
              an endodermal cell fate in the archenteron.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Eyes in bilaterian metazoans have been described as
              being composed of either ciliary or rhabdomeric photoreceptors.
              Phylogenetic distribution, as well as distinct morphologies and
              characteristic deployment of different photopigments (ciliary vs.
              rhabdomeric opsins) and transduction pathways argue for the
              co-existence of both of these two photoreceptor types in the last
              common bilaterian ancestor. Both receptor types exist throughout
              the Bilateria, but only vertebrates are thought to use ciliary
              photoreceptors for directional light detection in cerebral eyes,
              while all other invertebrate bilaterians studied utilize
              rhabdomeric photoreceptors for this purpose. In protostomes,
              ciliary photoreceptors that express c-opsin have been described
              only from a non-visual deep-brain photoreceptor. Their homology
              with vertebrate rods and cones of the human eye has been
              hypothesized to represent a unique functional transition from
              non-visual to visual roles in the vertebrate lineage. RESULTS: To
              test the hypothesis that protostome cerebral eyes employ
              exclusively rhabdomeric photoreceptors, we investigated the
              ultrastructure of the larval eyes in the brachiopod Terebratalia
              transversa. We show that these pigment-cup eyes consist of a lens
              cell and a shading pigment cell, both of which are putative
              photoreceptors, deploying a modified, enlarged cilium for light
              perception, and have axonal connections to the larval brain. Our
              investigation of the gene expression patterns of c-opsin, Pax6
              and otx in these eyes confirms that the larval eye spots of
              brachiopods are cerebral eyes that deploy ciliary type
              photoreceptors for directional light detection. Interestingly,
              c-opsin is also expressed during early embryogenesis in all
              potential apical neural cells, becoming restricted to the
              anterior neuroectoderm, before expression is initiated in the
              photoreceptor cells of the eyes. Coincident with the expression
              of c-opsin in the presumptive neuroectoderm, we found that middle
              gastrula stage embryos display a positive photoresponse behavior,
              in the absence of a discrete shading pigment or axonal
              connections between cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that
              the dichotomy in the deployment of ciliary and rhabdomeric
              photoreceptors for directional light detection is not as
              clear-cut as previously thought. Analyses of brachiopod larval
              eyes demonstrate that the utilization of c-opsin expressing
              ciliary photoreceptors in cerebral eyes is not limited to
              vertebrates. The presence of ciliary photoreceptor-based eyes in
              protostomes suggests that the transition between non-visual and
              visual functions of photoreceptors has been more evolutionarily
              labile than previously recognized, and that co-option of ciliary
              and rhabdomeric photoreceptor cell types for directional light
              detection has occurred multiple times during animal evolution. In
              addition, positive photoresponse behavior in gastrula stage
              embryos suggests that a discrete shading pigment is not requisite
              for directional photoreception in metazoans. Scanning
              photoreception of light intensities mediating cell-autonomous
              changes of ciliary movement may represent an ancient mechanism
              for regulating locomotory behavior, and is likely to have existed
              prior to the evolution of eye-mediated directional light
              detection employing axonal connections to effector cells and a
              discreet shading pigment.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Larval features such as the apical organ, apical
               ciliary tuft, and ciliated bands often complicate the evaluation
               of hypotheses regarding the origin of the adult bilaterian
               nervous system. Understanding how neurogenic domains form within
               the bilaterian head and larval apical organ requires expression
               data from animals that exhibit aspects of both centralized and
               diffuse nervous systems at different life history stages. Here,
               we describe the expression of eight neural-related genes during
               the larval development of the brachiopod, Terebratalia
               transversa. RESULTS: Radially symmetric gastrulae broadly
               express Tt-Six3/6 and Tt-hbn in the animal cap ectoderm.
               Tt-NK2.1 and Tt-otp are restricted to a central subset of these
               cells, and Tt-fez and Tt-FoxQ2 expression domains are already
               asymmetric at this stage. As gastrulation proceeds, the spatial
               expression of these genes is split between two anterior
               ectodermal domains, a more dorsal region comprised of Tt-Six3/6,
               Tt-fez, Tt-FoxQ2, and Tt-otp expression domains, and an anterior
               ventral domain demarcated by Tt-hbn and Tt-NK2.1 expression.
               More posteriorly, the latter domains are bordered by Tt-FoxG
               expression in the region of the transverse ciliated band.
               Tt-synaptotagmin 1 is expressed throughout the anterior neural
               ectoderm. All genes are expressed late into larval development.
               The basiepithelial larval nervous system includes three
               neurogenic domains comprised of the more dorsal apical organ and
               a ventral cell cluster in the apical lobe as well as a
               mid-ventral band of neurons in the mantle lobe. Tt-otp is the
               only gene expressed in numerous flask-shaped cells of the apical
               organ and in a subset of neurons in the mantle lobe.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our expression data for Tt-Six3/6, Tt-FoxQ2, and
               Tt-otp confirm some aspects of bilaterian-wide conservation of
               spatial partitioning within anterior neurogenic domains and also
               suggest a common origin for central otp-positive cell types
               within the larval apical organs of spiralians. However, the
               field of sensory neurons within the larval apical organ of
               Terebratalia is broader and composed of more cells relative to
               those of other spiralian larvae. These cellular differences are
               mirrored in the broader spatial and temporal expression patterns
               of Tt-FoxQ2 and Tt-otp. Corresponding differences in the
               expression of Tt-hbn, Tt-NK2.1, and Tt-FoxG are also observed
               relative to their respective domains within the cerebral ganglia
               of spiralians. Based on these data we argue that the anterior
               region of the bilaterian stem species included Six3/6, NK2.1,
               otp, hbn, fez, and FoxQ2 expression domains that were
               subsequently modified within larval and adult neural tissues of
               protostome and deuterostome animals.",

               We screened the embryonic transcriptome of the onychophoran

              and multiple independent radiations within the Spiralia.
              V-type/scc and P-type/mcc type-receptors are present in
              cnidarians, protostomes and deuterostomes, and therefore they
              emerged early in TLR evolution, followed by a loss in
              xenacoelomorphs. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that TLRs
              cluster into three major clades: clade Î± is present in
              cnidarians, ecdysozoans, and spiralians; clade Î² in
              deuterostomes, ecdysozoans, and spiralians; and clade Î³ is only
              found in spiralians. Our stage-specific transcriptome and in situ
              hybridization analyses show that TLRs are expressed during
              development in all species analyzed, which indicates a broad role
              of TLRs during animal development. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
              suggest that a clade Î± TLR gene (TLR-Ca) and a clade Î²/Î³ TLR gene
              (TLR-CÎ²/Î³) were already present in the cnidarian-bilaterian
              common ancestor. However, although TLR-Ca was conserved in
              cnidarians, TLR-CÎ²/Î³ was lost during the early evolution of these
              taxa. Moreover, TLR-CÎ²/Î³ duplicated to generate TLR-CÎ² and TLR-CÎ³
              in the lineage to the last common protostome-deuterostome
              ancestor. TLR-Ca, TLR-CÎ² and TLR-CÎ³ further expanded generating
              the three major TLR clades. While all three clades radiated in
              several spiralian lineages, specific TLRs clades have been
              presumably lost in other lineages. Furthermore, the expression of
              the majority of these genes during protostome ontogeny suggests a
              likely role in development.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Wnt genes code for ligands that activate signaling
               pathways during development in Metazoa. Through the canonical
               Wnt (cWnt) signaling pathway, these genes regulate important
               processes in bilaterian development, such as establishing the
               anteroposterior axis and posterior growth. In Arthropoda, Wnt
               ligands also regulate segment polarity, and outgrowth and
               patterning of developing appendages. Arthropods are part of a
               lineage called Panarthropoda that includes Onychophora and
               Tardigrada. Previous studies revealed potential roles of Wnt
               genes in regulating posterior growth, segment polarity, and
               growth and patterning of legs in Onychophora. Unlike most other
               panarthropods, tardigrades lack posterior growth, but retain
               segmentation and appendages. Here, we investigated Wnt genes in
               tardigrades to gain insight into potential roles that these
               genes play during development of the highly compact and
               miniaturized tardigrade body plan. RESULTS: We analyzed
               published genomes for two representatives of Tardigrada,
               Hypsibius exemplaris and Ramazzottius varieornatus. We
               identified single orthologs of Wnt4, Wnt5, Wnt9, Wnt11, and
               WntA, as well as two Wnt16 paralogs in both tardigrade genomes.
               We only found a Wnt2 ortholog in H. exemplaris. We could not
               identify orthologs of Wnt1, Wnt6, Wnt7, Wnt8, or Wnt10. We
               identified most other components of cWnt signaling in both
               tardigrade genomes. However, we were unable to identify an
               ortholog of arrow/Lrp5/6, a gene that codes for a Frizzled
               co-receptor of Wnt ligands. Additionally, we found that some
               other animals that have lost several Wnt genes and are
               secondarily miniaturized, like tardigrades, are also missing an
               ortholog of arrow/Lrp5/6. We analyzed the embryonic expression
               patterns of Wnt genes in H. exemplaris during developmental
               stages that span the establishment of the AP axis through
               segmentation and leg development. We detected expression of all
               Wnt genes in H. exemplaris besides one of the Wnt16 paralogs.
               During embryo elongation, expression of several Wnt genes was
               restricted to the posterior pole or a region between the
               anterior and posterior poles. Wnt genes were expressed in
               distinct patterns during segmentation and development of legs in
               H. exemplaris, rather than in broadly overlapping patterns.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Wnt signaling has been
               highly modified in Tardigrada. While most components of cWnt
               signaling are conserved in tardigrades, we conclude that
               tardigrades have lost Wnt1, Wnt6, Wnt7, Wnt8, and Wnt10, along
               with arrow/Lrp5/6. Our expression data may indicate a conserved
               role of Wnt genes in specifying posterior identities during
               establishment of the AP axis. However, the loss of several Wnt
               genes and the distinct expression patterns of Wnt genes during
               segmentation and leg development may indicate that combinatorial
               interactions among Wnt genes are less important during
               tardigrade development compared to many other animals. Based on
               our results, and comparisons to previous studies, we speculate
               that the loss of several Wnt genes in Tardigrada may be related
               to a reduced number of cells and simplified development that
               accompanied miniaturization and anatomical simplification in
               this lineage.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Brachiopods undergo radial cleavage, which is
              distinct from the stereotyped development of closely related
              spiralian taxa. The mesoderm has been inferred to derive from the
              archenteron walls following gastrulation, and the primary
              mesoderm derivative in the larva is a complex musculature. To
              investigate the specification and differentiation of the mesoderm
              in the articulate brachiopod Terebratalia transversa, we have
              identified orthologs of genes involved in mesoderm development in
              other taxa and investigated their spatial and temporal expression
              during the embryonic and larval development of T. transversa.
              RESULTS: Orthologs of 17 developmental regulatory genes with
              roles in the development of the mesoderm in other bilaterian
              animals were found to be expressed in the developing mesoderm of
              T. transversa. Five genes, Tt.twist, Tt.GATA456, Tt.dachshund,
              Tt.mPrx, and Tt.NK1, were found to have expression throughout the
              archenteron wall at the radial gastrula stage, shortly after the
              initiation of gastrulation. Three additional genes, Tt.Pax1/9,
              Tt.MyoD, and Tt.Six1/2, showed expression at this stage in only a
              portion of the archenteron wall. Tt.eya, Tt.FoxC, Tt.FoxF,
              Tt.Mox, Tt.paraxis, Tt.Limpet, and Tt.Mef2 all showed initial
              mesodermal expression during later gastrula or early larval
              stages. At the late larval stage, Tt.dachshund, Tt.Limpet, and
              Tt.Mef2 showed expression in nearly all mesoderm cells, while all
              other genes were localized to specific regions of the mesoderm.
              Tt.FoxD and Tt.noggin both showed expression in the ventral
              mesoderm at the larval stages, with gastrula expression patterns
              in the archenteron roof and blastopore lip, respectively.
              CONCLUSIONS: Expression analyses support conserved roles for
              developmental regulators in the specification and differentiation
              of the mesoderm during the development of T. transversa.
              Expression of multiple mesodermal factors in the archenteron wall
              during gastrulation supports previous morphological observations

              expression domains during gastrulation and larval development
              evidence early regionalization of the mesoderm and provide a

              transduction pathways important for axis formation, cell fate
              specification, and organogenesis throughout metazoan development.
              Within the various Wnt pathways, the frizzled transmembrane
              receptors (Fzs) and secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs)
              play central roles in receiving and antagonizing Wnt signals,
              respectively. Despite their importance, very little is known
              about the frizzled-related gene family (fzs \& sfrps) in
              lophotrochozoans, especially during early stages of spiralian
              development. Here we ascertain the frizzled-related gene
              complement in six lophotrochozoan species, and determine their
              spatial and temporal expression pattern during early
              embryogenesis and larval stages of the marine annelid Platynereis
              dumerilii. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses confirm conserved
              homologs for four frizzled receptors (Fz1/2/7, Fz4, Fz5/8,
              Fz9/10) and sFRP1/2/5 in five of six lophotrochozoan species. The
              sfrp3/4 gene is conserved in one, divergent in two, and evidently
              lost in three lophotrochozoan species. Three novel fz-related
              genes (fzCRD1-3) are unique to Platynereis. Transcriptional
              profiling and in situ hybridization identified high maternal
              expression of fz1/2/7, expression of fz9/10 and fz1/2/7 within
              animal and dorsal cell lineages after the 32-cell stage,
              localization of fz5/8, sfrp1/2/5, and fzCRD-1 to animal-pole cell
              lineages after the 80-cell stage, and no expression for fz4,
              sfrp3/4, and fzCRD-2, and -3 in early Platynereis embryos. In
              later larval stages, all frizzled-related genes are expressed in
              distinct patterns preferentially in the anterior hemisphere and
              less in the developing trunk. CONCLUSIONS: Lophotrochozoans have
              retained a generally conserved ancestral bilaterian
              frizzled-related gene complement (four Fzs and two sFRPs).
              Maternal expression of fz1/2/7, and animal lineage-specific
              expression of fz5/8 and sfrp1/2/5 in early embryos of Platynereis
              suggest evolutionary conserved roles of these genes to perform
              Wnt pathway functions during early cleavage stages, and the early
              establishment of a Wnt inhibitory center at the animal pole,
              respectively. Numerous frizzled receptor-expressing cells and
              embryonic territories were identified that might indicate
              competence to receive Wnt signals during annelid development. An
              anterior bias for frizzled-related gene expression in embryos and
              larvae might point to a polarity of Wnt patterning systems along
              the anterior-posterior axis of this annelid.",

              (echinoderms, hemichordates, urochordates, cephalochordates, and
              vertebrates) is progressively restricted along the
              anterior-posterior axis to a domain around the anterior pole. In
              the sea urchin embryo, three integrated Wnt signaling branches
              (Wnt/Î²-catenin, Wnt/JNK, and Wnt/PKC) govern this progressive
              restriction process, which begins around the 32- to 60-cell stage
              and terminates by the early gastrula stage. We previously have
              established that several secreted Wnt modulators of the Dickkopf
              and secreted Frizzled-related protein families (Dkk1, Dkk3, and
              sFRP-1/5) are expressed within the ANE and play important roles
              in modulating the Wnt signaling network during this process. In
              this study, we use morpholino and dominant-negative interference
              approaches to characterize the function of a novel
              Frizzled-related protein, secreted Frizzled-related protein 1
              (sFRP-1), during ANE restriction. sFRP-1 appears to be related to
              a secreted Wnt modulator, sFRP3/4, that is essential to block Wnt
              signaling and establish the ANE in vertebrates. Here, we show
              that the sea urchin sFRP3/4 orthologue is not expressed during
              ANE restriction in the sea urchin embryo. Instead, our results
              indicate that ubiquitously expressed maternal sFRP-1 and Fzl1/2/7
              signaling act together as early as the 32- to 60-cell stage to
              antagonize the ANE restriction mechanism mediated by
              Wnt/Î²-catenin and Wnt/JNK signaling. Then, starting from the
              blastula stage, Fzl5/8 signaling activates zygotic sFRP-1 within
              the ANE territory, where it works with the secreted Wnt
              antagonist Dkk1 (also activated by Fzl5/8 signaling) to
              antagonize Wnt1/Wnt8-Fzl5/8-JNK signaling in a negative feedback
              mechanism that defines the outer ANE territory boundary.
              Together, these data indicate that maternal and zygotic sFRP-1
              protects the ANE territory by antagonizing the
              Wnt1/Wnt8-Fzl5/8-JNK signaling pathway throughout ANE
              restriction, providing precise spatiotemporal control of the
              mechanism responsible for the establishment of the ANE territory
              around the anterior pole of the sea urchin embryo.",

  author   = "GÄsiorowski, Ludwik and Hejnol, Andreas",
  abstract = "Background: Hox genes encode a family of homeodomain containing
              transcription factors that are clustered together on chromosomes
              of many Bilateria. Some bilaterian lineages express these genes
              during embryogenesis in spatial and/or temporal order according
              to their arrangement in the cluster, a phenomenon referred to as
              collinearity. Expression of Hox genes is well studied during
              embryonic and larval development of numerous species; however,
              relatively few studies focus on the comparison of pre- and
              postmetamorphic expression of Hox genes in animals with biphasic
              life cycle. Recently, the expression of Hox genes was described
              for embryos and larvae of Terebratalia transversa, a
              rhynchonelliformean brachiopod, which possesses distinct
              metamorphosis from planktonic larvae to sessile juveniles. During
              premetamorphic development, T. transversa does not exhibit
              spatial collinearity and several of its Hox genes are recruited
              for the morphogenesis of novel structures. In our study, we
              determined the expression of Hox genes in postmetamorphic
              juveniles of T. transversa in order to examine
              metamorphosis-related changes of expression patterns and to test
              whether Hox genes are expressed in the spatially collinear way in
              the postmetamorphic juveniles. Results: Hox genes are expressed
              in a spatially non-collinear manner in juveniles, generally
              showing similar patterns as ones observed in competent larvae:
              genes labial and post1 are expressed in chaetae-related
              structures, sex combs reduced in the shell-forming epithelium,
              whereas lox5 and lox4 in dorso-posterior epidermis. After
              metamorphosis, expression of genes proboscipedia, hox3, deformed
              and antennapedia becomes restricted to, respectively, shell
              musculature, prospective hinge rudiments and pedicle musculature
              and epidermis. Conclusions: All developmental stages of T.
              transversa, including postmetamorphic juveniles, exhibit a
              spatial non-collinear Hox genes expression with only minor
              changes observed between pre- and postmetamorphic stages. Our
              results are concordant with morphological observation that
              metamorphosis in rhynchonelliformean brachiopods, despite being
              rapid, is rather gradual. The most drastic changes in Hox gene
              expression patterns observed during metamorphosis could be
              explained by the inversion of the mantle lobe, which relocates
              some of the more posterior larval structures into the anterior
              edge of the juveniles. Co-option of Hox genes for the
              morphogenesis of novel structures is even more pronounced in
              postmetamorphic brachiopods when compared to larvae.",

              the location in the neural plate where the organizer forms, but
              it is unclear how this location is set up. Using mutant analyses
              and shield ablation experiments in zebrafish, we find that axial
              mesendoderm, as a candidate tissue, has only a minor role in
              positioning the MHB. Instead, the blastoderm margin of the
              gastrula embryo acts as a source of signal(s) involved in this
              process. We demonstrate that positioning of the MHB organizer is
              tightly linked to overall neuroectodermal posteriorization, and
              specifically depends on Wnt8 signaling emanating from lateral
              mesendodermal precursors. Wnt8 is required for the initial
              subdivision of the neuroectoderm, including onset of posterior

              Wnt8 signaling acts directly and non-cell-autonomously.
              Consistent with these findings, a GFP-Wnt8 fusion protein travels
              from donor cells through early neural plate tissue. Our findings
              argue that graded Wnt8 activity mediates overall neuroectodermal

              beta-catenin stabilisation is a key early step in embryonic
              patterning in many metazoans, including the basally diverging
              cnidarians, but the upstream maternal cues appear surprisingly
              variable. In Clytia, regionalised beta-catenin stabilisation
              defining a presumptive 'oral' territory is determined by two

              localisation and function. We have identified a maternally coded
              ligand, CheWnt3, the RNA of which is localised to the animal
              cortex (future oral side) of the egg. Antisense morpholino
              oligonucleotide experiments showed that CheWnt3 is required
              maternally for regionalised oral beta-catenin stabilisation in
              the early embryo, being only the second clear example of a
              maternally required Wnt ligand after Xenopus Xwnt11. In line with
              the determinant role of the maternally localised Frizzleds,
              CheWnt3 overexpression by RNA injection initially had little
              effect on establishing the oral domain. Subsequently, however,
              overexpression had dramatic consequences for axis development,
              causing progressive expansion of beta-catenin stabilisation to
              yield spherical 'oralised' larvae. Upregulation of both CheFz1
              and CheFz3 RNAs in CheWnt3 morpholino embryos indicated that
              CheWnt3 participates in an active axial patterning system

              oral and aboral territories. Localised introduction of CheWnt3

              eumetazoans. In Clytia, two variant Frizzled receptors and one

              necessary and sufficient to initiate patterning along the primary
              and secondary axes, respectively. Here we define and characterize
              a third patterning center, the animal pole domain (APD), which
              contains neurogenic ectoderm, and can oppose Wnt and Nodal
              signaling. The regulatory influence of the APD is normally
              restricted to the animal pole region, but can operate in most
              cells of the embryo because, in the absence of Wnt and Nodal, the
              APD expands throughout the embryo. We have identified many
              constituent APD regulatory genes expressed in the early blastula
              and have shown that expression of most of them requires Six3

              functions at or near the top of several APD gene regulatory

              an ancient program for patterning the secondary, or dorsoventral,
              body axis, but any such program for the primary, or
              anteroposterior, body axis is debated. Recent work in
              invertebrates indicates that posterior Wnt/beta-catenin signaling

              of perpendicular Wnt and BMP signaling is conserved in
              bilaterians, orchestrates body axis patterning and contributes to

              activation of the endomesoderm gene regulatory network. Beyond
              that, little is known about how the embryo uses maternal
              information to initiate specification. Here, experiments
              establish that of the three maternal Wnts in the egg, Wnt6 is
              necessary for activation of endodermal genes in the endomesoderm
              GRN. A small region of the vegetal cortex is shown to be
              necessary for activation of the endomesoderm GRN. If that
              cortical region of the egg is removed, addition of Wnt6 rescues
              endoderm. At a molecular level, the vegetal cortex region
              contains a localized concentration of Dishevelled (Dsh) protein,
              a transducer of the canonical Wnt pathway; however, Wnt6 mRNA is
              not similarly localized. Ectopic activation of the Wnt pathway,
              through the expression of an activated form of Î²-catenin, of a
              dominant-negative variant of GSK-3Î² or of Dsh itself, rescues
              endomesoderm specification in eggs depleted of the vegetal
              cortex. Knockdown experiments in whole embryos show that absence
              of Wnt6 produces embryos that lack endoderm, but those embryos
              continue to express a number of mesoderm markers. Thus, maternal
              Wnt6 plus a localized vegetal cortical molecule, possibly Dsh, is
              necessary for endoderm specification; this has been verified in
              two species of sea urchin. The data also show that Wnt6 is only
              one of what are likely to be multiple components that are
              necessary for activation of the entire endomesoderm gene

               involved in germ layer specification, posterior growth and
               patterning of the anteroposterior axis. Results from animals
               spanning a wide phylogenetic range suggest that a unifying
               function of Î²-catenin in metazoans is to define the
               posterior/vegetal part of the embryo. Although the specification
               of vegetal territories (endoderm) by Î²-catenin has been
               demonstrated in distantly related animals (cnidarians, a
               protostome, echinoderms and ascidians), the definition of the
               posterior part of the embryo is well supported only for
               vertebrates and planarians. To gain insights into Î²-catenin
               functions during deuterostome evolution, we have studied the
               early development of the direct developing hemichordate
               Saccoglossus kowalevskii. We show that the zygote is polarized
               after fertilization along the animal-vegetal axis by cytoplasmic
               rearrangements resembling the ascidian vegetal contraction. This
               early asymmetry is translated into nuclear accumulation of
               Î²-catenin at the vegetal pole, which is necessary and sufficient
               to specify endomesoderm. We show that endomesoderm specification
               is crucial for anteroposterior axis establishment in the
               ectoderm. The endomesoderm secretes as yet unidentified signals
               that posteriorize the ectoderm, which would otherwise adopt an
               anterior fate. Our results point to a conserved function at the
               base of deuterostomes for Î²-catenin in germ layer specification
               and to a causal link in the definition of the posterior part of
               the embryonic ectoderm by way of activating posteriorizing
               endomesodermal factors. Consequently, the definition of the
               vegetal and the posterior regions of the embryo by Î²-catenin

               FoxQ2, controls aboral development in cnidarians and anterior

               these two patterning systems are initially set up in order to

               Investigating the early steps of aboral pole formation in the
               sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, we found that, at blastula
               stage, oral genes are expressed before aboral genes and that
               NvÎ²-catenin regulates both oral and aboral development. In the
               oral hemisphere, NvÎ²-catenin specifies all subdomains except the
               oral-most, NvSnailA-expressing domain, which is expanded upon
               NvÎ²-catenin knockdown. In addition, NvÎ²-catenin establishes the
               aboral patterning system by promoting the expression of NvSix3/6
               at the aboral pole and suppressing the Wnt receptor
               NvFrizzled5/8 at the oral pole. NvFrizzled5/8 expression thereby
               gets restricted to the aboral domain. At gastrula stage,
               NvSix3/6 and NvFrizzled5/8 are both expressed in the aboral
               domain, but they have opposing activities, with NvSix3/6
               maintaining and NvFrizzled5/8 restricting the size of the aboral
               domain. At planula stage, NvFrizzled5/8 is required for
               patterning within the aboral domain and for regulating the size
               of the apical organ by modulation of a previously characterized
               FGF feedback loop. Our findings suggest conserved roles for

              proposed to be paramount in the specification of the posterior
              compartment identity. Here, we explore the adult en function by
              targeting its expression in different regions of the wing disc.
              In the anterior compartment, ectopic en expression gives rise to
              the substitution of anterior structures by posterior ones, thus
              demonstrating its role in specification of posterior patterns.
              The en-expressing cells in the anterior compartment also induce
              high levels of the hedgehog (hh) and decapentaplegic (dpp) gene
              products, which results in local duplications of anterior
              patterns. Besides, hh is able to activate en and the
              engrailed-related gene invected (inv) in this compartment. In the

              mechanism. We propose that en has a dual role: a general one for
              patterning of the appendage, achieved through the activation of
              secreted proteins like hh and dpp, and a more specific one,

  abstract  = "Gastrulation in the amphibian embryo is driven by cells of the
               mesoderm. One of the genes that confers mesodermal identity in
               Xenopus is Brachyury (Xbra), which is required for normal
               gastrulation movements and ultimately for posterior mesoderm and
               notochord differentiation in the development of all vertebrates.
               Xbra is a transcription activator, and interference with
               transcription activation leads to an inhibition of morphogenetic
               movements during gastrulation. To understand this process, we
               have screened for downstream target genes of Brachyury (Tada,
               M., Casey, E., Fairclough, L. and Smith, J. C. (1998)
               Development 125, 3997-4006). This approach has now allowed us to
               isolate Xwnt11, whose expression pattern is almost identical to
               that of Xbra at gastrula and early neurula stages. Activation of
               Xwnt11 is induced in an immediate-early fashion by Xbra and its
               expression in vivo is abolished by a dominant-interfering form
               of Xbra, Xbra-En(R). Overexpression of a dominant-negative form
               of Xwnt11, like overexpression of Xbra-En(R), inhibits
               convergent extension movements. This inhibition can be rescued
               by Dsh, a component of the Wnt signalling pathway and also by a
               truncated form of Dsh which cannot signal through the canonical
               Wnt pathway involving GSK-3 and (beta)-catenin. Together, our
               results suggest that the regulation of morphogenetic movements
               by Xwnt11 occurs through a pathway similar to that involved in
               planar polarity signalling in Drosophila.",

              intestinalis and C. savignyi and obtained the following results:
              (1) During cleavages, (beta)-catenin accumulated in the nuclei of
              vegetal blastomeres, suggesting that it plays a role in the
              specification of endoderm. (2) Mis- and/or overexpression of
              (beta)-catenin induced the development of an endoderm-specific
              alkaline phosphatase (AP) in presumptive notochord cells and
              epidermis cells without affecting differentiation of primary
              lineage muscle cells. (3) Downregulation of (beta)-catenin
              induced by the overexpression of cadherin resulted in the
              suppression of endoderm cell differentiation. This suppression
              was compensated for by the differentiation of extra epidermis
              cells. (4) Specification of notochord cells did not take place in
              the absence of endoderm differentiation. Both the overexpression

              led to the suppression of Brachyury gene expression, resulting in
              the failure of notochord specification. These results suggest
              that the accumulation of (beta)-catenin in the nuclei of endoderm

  abstract  = "The dorsal ectoderm of the vertebrate gastrula was proposed by
               Nieuwkoop to be specified towards an anterior neural fate by an
               activation signal, with its subsequent regionalization along the
               anteroposterior (AP) axis regulated by a graded transforming
               activity, leading to a properly patterned forebrain, midbrain,
               hindbrain and spinal cord. The activation phase involves
               inhibition of BMP signals by dorsal antagonists, but the later
               caudalization process is much more poorly characterized. Explant
               and overexpression studies in chick, Xenopus, mouse and
               zebrafish implicate lateral/paraxial mesoderm in supplying the
               transforming influence, which is largely speculated to be a Wnt
               family member. We have analyzed the requirement for the specific
               ventrolaterally expressed Wnt8 ligand in the posteriorization of
               neural tissue in zebrafish wild-type and Nodal-deficient embryos
               (Antivin overexpressing or cyclops;squint double mutants), which
               show extensive AP brain patterning in the absence of dorsal
               mesoderm. In different genetic situations that vary the extent
               of mesodermal precursor formation, the presence of lateral
               wnt8-expressing cells correlates with the establishment of AP
               brain pattern. Cell tracing experiments show that the
               neuroectoderm of Nodal-deficient embryos undergoes a rapid
               anterior-to-posterior transformation in vivo during a short
               period at the end of the gastrula stage. Moreover, in both
               wild-type and Nodal-deficient embryos, inactivation of Wnt8
               function by morpholino (MO(wnt8)) translational interference
               dose-dependently abrogates formation of spinal cord and
               posterior brain fates, without blocking ventrolateral mesoderm
               formation. MO(wnt8) also suppresses the forebrain deficiency in
               bozozok mutants, in which inactivation of a homeobox gene causes
               ectopic wnt8 expression. In addition, the bozozok forebrain
               reduction is suppressed in bozozok;squint;cyclops triple
               mutants, and is associated with reduced wnt8 expression, as seen
               in cyclops;squint mutants. Hence, whereas boz and Nodal
               signaling largely cooperate in gastrula organizer formation,
               they have opposing roles in regulating wnt8 expression and
               forebrain specification. Our findings provide strong support for
               a model of neural transformation in which a planar
               gastrula-stage Wnt8 signal, promoted by Nodal signaling and
               dorsally limited by Bozozok, acts on anterior neuroectoderm from
               the lateral mesoderm to produce the AP regional patterning of
               the CNS.",

               Here, we investigated the role of FGF signaling in mesoderm
               development in three species of lophophorates, a clade within

               recruitment of transcription factors differs significantly.
               Moreover, the use of the inhibitor SU5402 demonstrates that FGF

              used cell-cell communication pathway involving Wnt signalling.
              Because of their homology with the Wnt-binding domain on the Fz

  abstract = "The Wnts comprise a large class of secreted proteins that control
              essential developmental processes such as embryonic patterning,
              cell growth, migration, and differentiation. In the most
              well-understood ``canonical'' Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt binding
              to Frizzled receptors induces beta-catenin protein stabilization
              and entry into the nucleus, where it complexes with T-cell
              factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors to affect
              the transcription of target genes. In addition to the canonical
              pathway, evidence for several other Wnt signaling pathways has
              accumulated, in particular for Wnt5a, which has therefore been
              classified as a noncanonical Wnt family member. To study the
              alternative mechanisms by which Wnt proteins signal, we purified
              the Wnt5a protein to homogeneity. We find that purified Wnt5a
              inhibits Wnt3a protein-induced canonical Wnt signaling in a
              dose-dependent manner, not by influencing beta-catenin levels but
              by downregulating beta-catenin-induced reporter gene expression.
              The Wnt5a signal is mediated by the orphan tyrosine kinase Ror2,
              is pertussis toxin insensitive, and does not influence cellular
              calcium levels. We show that in addition to its inhibitory
              function, Wnt5a can also activate beta-catenin signaling in the
              presence of the appropriate Frizzled receptor, Frizzled 4. Thus,
              this study shows for the first time that a single Wnt ligand can
              initiate discrete signaling pathways through the activation of
              two distinct receptors. Based on these and additional
              observations, we propose a model wherein receptor context
              dictates Wnt signaling output. In this model, signaling by
              different Wnt family members is not intrinsically regulated by
              the Wnt proteins themselves but by receptor availability.",

               axis is a critical event in the early development of
               deuterostome embryos. However, the mechanisms that regulate the
               specification and patterning of the neuroectoderm are
               incompletely understood. Remarkably, the anterior neuroectoderm
               (ANE) of the deuterostome sea urchin embryo expresses many of
               the same transcription factors and secreted modulators of Wnt
               signaling, as does the early vertebrate ANE (forebrain/eye
               field). Moreover, as is the case in vertebrate embryos,
               confining the ANE to the anterior end of the embryo requires a
               Wnt/Î²-catenin-dependent signaling mechanism. Here we use
               morpholino- or dominant negative-mediated interference to
               demonstrate that the early sea urchin embryo integrates
               information not only from Wnt/Î²-catenin but also from
               Wnt/Fzl5/8-JNK and Fzl1/2/7-PKC pathways to provide precise
               spatiotemporal control of neuroectoderm patterning along its AP
               axis. Together, through the Wnt1 and Wnt8 ligands, they
               orchestrate a progressive posterior-to-anterior wave of
               re-specification that restricts the initial, ubiquitous,
               maternally specified, ANE regulatory state to the most anterior
               blastomeres. There, the Wnt receptor antagonist, Dkk1, protects
               this state through a negative feedback mechanism. Because these
               different Wnt pathways converge on the same cell fate
               specification process, our data suggest they may function as
               integrated components of an interactive Wnt signaling network.
               Our findings provide strong support for the idea that the sea
               urchin ANE regulatory state and the mechanisms that position and
               define its borders represent an ancient regulatory patterning
               system that was present in the common echinoderm/vertebrate

              the evolution of animal body plans. The head of bilaterians
              develops at the anterior end of their primary body axis and is
              the site where the brain is located. Cnidarians, the sister group
              to bilaterians, lack brain-like structures and it is not clear
              whether the oral, the aboral, or none of the ends of the
              cnidarian primary body axis corresponds to the anterior domain of
              bilaterians. In order to understand the evolutionary origin of
              head development, we analysed the function of conserved genetic
              regulators of bilaterian anterior development in the sea anemone
              Nematostella vectensis. We show that orthologs of the bilaterian
              anterior developmental genes six3/6, foxQ2, and irx have dynamic
              expression patterns in the aboral region of Nematostella.
              Functional analyses reveal that NvSix3/6 acts upstream of
              NvFoxQ2a as a key regulator of the development of a broad aboral
              territory in Nematostella. NvSix3/6 initiates an autoregulatory
              feedback loop involving positive and negative regulators of FGF
              signalling, which subsequently results in the downregulation of
              NvSix3/6 and NvFoxQ2a in a small domain at the aboral pole, from
              which the apical organ develops. We show that signalling by
              NvFGFa1 is specifically required for the development of the
              apical organ, whereas NvSix3/6 has an earlier and broader
              function in the specification of the aboral territory. Our
              functional and gene expression data suggest that the head-forming
              region of bilaterians is derived from the aboral domain of the

               predominantly on data from vertebrate embryogenesis as well as
               planarian regeneration and homeostasis, indicating that
               canonical Wnt (cWnt) signaling endows cells with positional
               information along the A/P axis. Outside of these phyla, there is
               strong support for a conserved role of cWnt signaling in the
               repression of anterior fates, but little comparative support for
               a conserved role in promotion of posterior fates. We further
               test the hypothesis by investigating the role of cWnt signaling
               during early patterning along the A/P axis of the hemichordate
               Saccoglossus kowalevskii. We have cloned and investigated the
               expression of the complete Wnt ligand and Frizzled receptor
               complement of S. kowalevskii during early development along with
               many secreted Wnt modifiers. Eleven of the 13 Wnt ligands are
               ectodermally expressed in overlapping domains, predominantly in
               the posterior, and Wnt antagonists are localized predominantly
               to the anterior ectoderm in a pattern reminiscent of their
               distribution in vertebrate embryos. Overexpression and knockdown
               experiments, in combination with embryological manipulations,
               establish the importance of cWnt signaling for repression of
               anterior fates and activation of mid-axial ectodermal fates
               during the early development of S. kowalevskii. However,
               surprisingly, terminal posterior fates, defined by posterior Hox
               genes, are unresponsive to manipulation of cWnt levels during
               the early establishment of the A/P axis at late blastula and
               early gastrula. We establish experimental support for a
               conserved role of Wnt signaling in the early specification of
               the A/P axis during deuterostome body plan diversification, and
               further build support for an ancestral role of this pathway in
               early evolution of the bilaterian A/P axis. We find strong
               support for a role of cWnt in suppression of anterior fates and
               promotion of mid-axial fates, but we find no evidence that cWnt
               signaling plays a role in the early specification of the most
               posterior axial fates in S. kowalevskii. This posterior autonomy

              flies. In a detailed comparative analysis, we have used in situ
              hybridization of 8.0- to 9.5-day mouse embryos to characterize
              expression of all ten published Wnt genes in the central nervous
              system (CNS) and limb buds. Seven of the family members show
              restricted expression patterns in the brain. At least three genes
              (Wnt-3, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-7b) exhibit sharp boundaries of
              expression in the forebrain that may predict subdivisions of the
              region later in development. In the spinal cord, Wnt-1, Wnt-3,
              and Wnt-3a are expressed dorsally, Wnt-5a, Wnt-7a, and Wnt-7b
              more ventrally, and Wnt-4 both dorsally and in the floor plate.
              In the forelimb primordia, Wnt-3, Wnt-4, Wnt-6 and Wnt-7b are
              expressed fairly uniformly throughout the limb ectoderm. Wnt-5a
              RNA is distributed in a proximal to distal gradient through the
              limb mesenchyme and ectoderm. Along the limb's dorsal-ventral
              axis, Wnt-5a is expressed in the ventral ectoderm and Wnt-7a in
              the dorsal ectoderm. We discuss the significance of these

  abstract = "Beta-catenin is thought to mediate cell fate specification events
              by localizing to the nucleus where it modulates gene expression.
              To ask whether beta-catenin is involved in cell fate
              specification during sea urchin embryogenesis, we analyzed the
              distribution of nuclear beta-catenin in both normal and
              experimentally manipulated embryos. In unperturbed embryos,
              beta-catenin accumulates in nuclei that include the precursors of
              the endoderm and mesoderm, suggesting that it plays a role in
              vegetal specification. Using pharmacological, embryological and
              molecular approaches, we determined the function of beta-catenin
              in vegetal development by examining the relationship between the
              pattern of nuclear beta-catenin and the formation of endodermal
              and mesodermal tissues. Treatment of embryos with LiCl, a known
              vegetalizing agent, caused both an enhancement in the levels of
              nuclear beta-catenin and an expansion in the pattern of nuclear
              beta-catenin that coincided with an increase in endoderm and
              mesoderm. Conversely, overexpression of a sea urchin cadherin
              blocked the accumulation of nuclear beta-catenin and consequently
              inhibited the formation of endodermal and mesodermal tissues
              including micromere-derived skeletogenic mesenchyme. In addition,
              nuclear beta-catenin-deficient micromeres failed to induce a
              secondary axis when transplanted to the animal pole of uninjected
              host embryos, indicating that nuclear beta-catenin also plays a
              role in the production of micromere-derived signals. To examine
              further the relationship between nuclear beta-catenin in vegetal
              nuclei and micromere signaling, we performed both
              transplantations and deletions of micromeres at the 16-cell stage
              and demonstrated that the accumulation of beta-catenin in vegetal
              nuclei does not require micromere-derived cues. Moreover, we
              demonstrate that cell autonomous signals appear to regulate the
              pattern of nuclear beta-catenin since dissociated blastomeres
              possessed nuclear beta-catenin in approximately the same
              proportion as that seen in intact embryos. Together, these data
              show that the accumulation of beta-catenin in nuclei of vegetal
              cells is regulated cell autonomously and that this localization
              is required for the establishment of all vegetal cell fates and
              the production of micromere-derived signals.",
