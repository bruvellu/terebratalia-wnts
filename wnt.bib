              their data. UGENE integrates widely used bioinformatics tools
              within a common user interface. The toolkit supports multiple
              biological data formats and allows the retrieval of data from
              remote data sources. It provides visualization modules for
              biological objects such as annotated genome sequences, Next
              Generation Sequencing (NGS) assembly data, multiple sequence
              alignments, phylogenetic trees and 3D structures. Most of the
              integrated algorithms are tuned for maximum performance by the
              usage of multithreading and special processor instructions. UGENE
              includes a visual environment for creating reusable workflows
              that can be launched on local resources or in a High Performance
              Computing (HPC) environment. UGENE is written in C++ using the Qt

  title    = "Improvement of phylogenies after removing divergent and
              ambiguously aligned blocks from protein sequence alignments",
  author   = "Talavera, Gerard and Castresana, Jose",
  abstract = "Alignment quality may have as much impact on phylogenetic
              reconstruction as the phylogenetic methods used. Not only the
              alignment algorithm, but also the method used to deal with the
              most problematic alignment regions, may have a critical effect on
              the final tree. Although some authors remove such problematic
              regions, either manually or using automatic methods, in order to
              improve phylogenetic performance, others prefer to keep such
              regions to avoid losing any information. Our aim in the present
              work was to examine whether phylogenetic reconstruction improves
              after alignment cleaning or not. Using simulated protein
              alignments with gaps, we tested the relative performance in
              diverse phylogenetic analyses of the whole alignments versus the
              alignments with problematic regions removed with our previously
              developed Gblocks program. We also tested the performance of more
              or less stringent conditions in the selection of blocks.
              Alignments constructed with different alignment methods
              (ClustalW, Mafft, and Probcons) were used to estimate
              phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and
              parsimony. We show that, in most alignment conditions, and for
              alignments that are not too short, removal of blocks leads to
              better trees. That is, despite losing some information, there is
              an increase in the actual phylogenetic signal. Overall, the best
              trees are obtained by maximum-likelihood reconstruction of
              alignments cleaned by Gblocks. In general, a relaxed selection of
              blocks is better for short alignment, whereas a stringent
              selection is more adequate for longer ones. Finally, we show that
              cleaned alignments produce better topologies although,
              paradoxically, with lower bootstrap. This indicates that
              divergent and problematic alignment regions may lead, when
              present, to apparently better supported although, in fact, more
              biased topologies.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important
              bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
              (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics,
              the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very
              long queries or database sequences. There are also some
              shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line
              applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of
              rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line
              applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for
              processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run
              times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve
              only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and
              memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of
              contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking
              information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A
              new modular software library can now access subject sequence data
              from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features,
              including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse
              their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded
              to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The
              new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current
              BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long
              queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Larval features such as the apical organ, apical
               ciliary tuft, and ciliated bands often complicate the evaluation
               of hypotheses regarding the origin of the adult bilaterian
               nervous system. Understanding how neurogenic domains form within
               the bilaterian head and larval apical organ requires expression
               data from animals that exhibit aspects of both centralized and
               diffuse nervous systems at different life history stages. Here,
               we describe the expression of eight neural-related genes during
               the larval development of the brachiopod, Terebratalia
               transversa. RESULTS: Radially symmetric gastrulae broadly
               express Tt-Six3/6 and Tt-hbn in the animal cap ectoderm.
               Tt-NK2.1 and Tt-otp are restricted to a central subset of these
               cells, and Tt-fez and Tt-FoxQ2 expression domains are already
               asymmetric at this stage. As gastrulation proceeds, the spatial
               expression of these genes is split between two anterior
               ectodermal domains, a more dorsal region comprised of Tt-Six3/6,
               Tt-fez, Tt-FoxQ2, and Tt-otp expression domains, and an anterior
               ventral domain demarcated by Tt-hbn and Tt-NK2.1 expression.
               More posteriorly, the latter domains are bordered by Tt-FoxG
               expression in the region of the transverse ciliated band.
               Tt-synaptotagmin 1 is expressed throughout the anterior neural
               ectoderm. All genes are expressed late into larval development.
               The basiepithelial larval nervous system includes three
               neurogenic domains comprised of the more dorsal apical organ and
               a ventral cell cluster in the apical lobe as well as a
               mid-ventral band of neurons in the mantle lobe. Tt-otp is the
               only gene expressed in numerous flask-shaped cells of the apical
               organ and in a subset of neurons in the mantle lobe.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our expression data for Tt-Six3/6, Tt-FoxQ2, and
               Tt-otp confirm some aspects of bilaterian-wide conservation of
               spatial partitioning within anterior neurogenic domains and also
               suggest a common origin for central otp-positive cell types
               within the larval apical organs of spiralians. However, the
               field of sensory neurons within the larval apical organ of
               Terebratalia is broader and composed of more cells relative to
               those of other spiralian larvae. These cellular differences are
               mirrored in the broader spatial and temporal expression patterns
               of Tt-FoxQ2 and Tt-otp. Corresponding differences in the
               expression of Tt-hbn, Tt-NK2.1, and Tt-FoxG are also observed
               relative to their respective domains within the cerebral ganglia
               of spiralians. Based on these data we argue that the anterior
               region of the bilaterian stem species included Six3/6, NK2.1,
               otp, hbn, fez, and FoxQ2 expression domains that were
               subsequently modified within larval and adult neural tissues of
               protostome and deuterostome animals.",

              incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer

              use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also
              added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to
              save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require
              that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair.

              used cell-cell communication pathway involving Wnt signalling.
              Because of their homology with the Wnt-binding domain on the Fz
